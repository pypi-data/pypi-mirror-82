Description: Lea is a Python module aiming at working with discrete probability distributions in an intuitive way.
        
        It allows you modeling a broad range of random phenomena: gambling, weather, finance, etc. More generally, Lea may be used for any finite set of discrete values having known probability: numbers, booleans, date/times, symbols, ... Each probability distribution is modeled as a plain object, which can be named, displayed, queried or processed to produce new probability distributions.
        
        Lea also provides advanced functions and Probabilistic Programming (PP) features; these include conditional probabilities, JPD, CPT, BN, Markov chains and symbolic computation.
        
        Lea can be used for AI, machine learning, education, ...
        
        To install Lea 3.3.1, type the following command:
        ::
        
          pip install lea==3.3.1
        
        Please go on Lea project page (beside) for a comprehensive documentation.
