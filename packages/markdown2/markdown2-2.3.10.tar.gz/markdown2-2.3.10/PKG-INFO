Description: markdown2: A fast and complete Python implementation of Markdown.
        
        Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
        easy-to-write structured text format into HTML.  Markdown's text
        format is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports
        features such as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and
        links.  -- http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
        
        This is a fast and complete Python implementation of the Markdown
        spec. See http://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2 for more info.
