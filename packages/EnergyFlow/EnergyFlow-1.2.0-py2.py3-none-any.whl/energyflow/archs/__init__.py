r"""# Architectures

Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) and Particle Flow Networks (PFNs) are model
architectures designed for learning from collider events as unordered,
variable-length sets of particles. Both EFNs and PFNs are parameterized by a
learnable per-particle function $\Phi$ and latent space function $F$.

An EFN takes the following form:
$$\text{EFN}=F\left(\sum_{i=1}^M z_i \Phi(\hat p_i)\right)$$
where $z_i$ is a measure of the energy of particle $i$, such as $z_i=p_{T,i}$,
and $\hat p_i$ is a measure of the angular information of particle $i$, such as
$\hat p_i = (y_i,\phi_i)$. Any infrared- and collinear-safe observable can be
parameterized in this form.

A PFN takes the following form:
$$\text{PFN}=F\left(\sum_{i=1}^M \Phi(p_i)\right)$$
where $p_i$ is the information of particle $i$, such as its four-momentum,
charge, or flavor. Any observable can be parameterized in this form. See the
[Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) framework for additional 
discussion.

Since these architectures are not used by the core EnergyFlow code, and require
the external [Keras](https://keras.io) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-
learn.org/) libraries, they are not imported by default but must be explicitly
imported, e.g. `from energyflow.archs import *`. EnergyFlow also contains
several additional model architectures for ease of using common models that
frequently appear in the intersection of particle physics and machine learning.
