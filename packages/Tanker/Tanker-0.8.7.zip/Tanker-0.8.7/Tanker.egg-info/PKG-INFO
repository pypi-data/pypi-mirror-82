Description: 
        Tanker is a Python database library targeting analytic operations but
        it also fits most transactional processing.
        
        As its core it's mainly a query builder that simplify greatly the join
        operations. It also comes with an way to automatically create the
        database tables based on your schema definition.
        
        Currently Postgresql and Sqlite are supported and the API is made to
        seamlessly integrate with pandas DataFrames.
