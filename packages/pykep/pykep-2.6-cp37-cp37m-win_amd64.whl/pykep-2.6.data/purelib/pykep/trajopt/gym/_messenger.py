    This class represents a rendezvous mission to Mercury modelled as an MGA-1DSM transfer. The selected fly-by sequence,
    E-VVMeMeMe-Me, and other parameters are inspired to the Messenger mission. We have only omitted the first Earth fly-by that
    was used to correct for launcher performances, since we here do not make use of a launcher model.
    As far as chemical propelled interplanetary trajectories go, this particular one is particularly complex and difficult
    to design. The time of flights among successive Mercury fly-bys allow for multiple rvolutions and resonances, making
    optimization techniques struggle to find the correct combination.
    The amount of specialistic knowledge that needs to be used to obtain a successful design is significant.
    Finding a global optimization approach able to find a good trajectory in complete autonomy without making
    use of additional problem knowledge is possible, but limiting the number of fitness call is difficult.

       A significantly similar version of this problem was part of the no longer maintained GTOP database, 
       https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/gtop.html. The exact definition is, though, different and results
       cannot thus not be compared to those posted in GTOP.
