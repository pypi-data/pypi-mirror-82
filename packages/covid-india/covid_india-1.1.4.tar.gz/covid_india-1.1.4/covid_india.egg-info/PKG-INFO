        # COVID-19 India
        
        Python package for providing data for the `COVID-19` cases in India. This can provide data both online as well as offline.
        
        ## requirements
        
        For running this, you need to have `python3` installed on your system.
        
        ## Features
        
        This works both `online` as well as `offline`.
        
        ## Installation
        
        For windows
        
        ```
        pip install covid-india
        ```
        
        For linux and Mac
        
        ```
        pip3 install covid-india
        ```
        
        ## Example
        
        1. All the states
        
            ```
            from covid_india import states
            print(states.getdata())
            ```
        
            This returns a `json` object which contains the datas of all the states in India.
        
        2. Specific state
        
            ```
            from covid_india import states
            print(states.getdata('West Bengal'))
            ```
        
            This returns a `json` object containing only the datas of West Bengal.
        
        3. Total Count
        
            ```
            from covid_india import states
            print(states.getdata('Total'))
            ```
        
            This returns a `json` object containing only category wise count of all the cases in India.
        
        
        *If you use this package offline, you will get a timestamp along with the data stating when it was last updated.*
