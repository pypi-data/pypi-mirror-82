## Overview
This is the full API for Gradescope so you can autograde exams!

To install, run `pip install fullGSapi`. To develop, create a virtualenv and run `pip install -e .`.

This is an **unofficial** tool which allows you to interact with Gradescope. Please **DO NOT** use it to spam their servers (you should really use rate limiting on it).

This tool was created for educational purposes.
