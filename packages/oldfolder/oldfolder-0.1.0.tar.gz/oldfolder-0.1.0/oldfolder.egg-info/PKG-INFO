        Old Folder spring cleans a file directory by storing away subdirectories
        that haven't been modified for a given period.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Python 3.6+ must be preinstalled.
        
        Old Folder can then be pip installed from `PyPI`_ and used via a command line interface:
        
        .. code-block:: shell-session
        
         F:\>oldfolder -h
         usage: oldfolder [-h] [-t {modified,accessed,created}] path number storage
        
         Move old subdirectories that contain files which haven't been modified for
         a given period of time.
         Moves can also be specified based on created or accessed time.
        
         positional arguments:
          path                  Path of directory where subdirectories can be found.
          number                Number of years since files in subdirectories were
                                modified, accessed, or created.
          storage               Name of storage folder to place the old
                                subdirectories inside. The storage folder
                                location will be the specifed path.
        
         optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -t {modified,accessed,created}, --time_type {modified,accessed,created}
                                Time stat type to base the move on.
        
        Or you can run it directly:
        
        .. code-block:: shell-session
        
         F:\>py oldfolder.py -h
        
        Pass the path of the main directory, the length of time and the storage folder name to the program:
        
        .. code-block:: shell-session
        
         F:\>oldfolder "F:\main_directory" 1.5 "old_stuff"
        
        Subdirectories that don't contain any files modified during the period will be listed for storage:
        
        .. code-block:: shell-session
        
         Based on the modified times of the files contained within them,
         the subdirectories that will be moved to the old_stuff folder are:
                  old_files_1
                  old_files_2

            import oldfolder
        
        
            file_operations = oldfolder.prepare_move("F:\main_directory" 1.5 "old_stuff")
        
            oldfolder.move_files(file_operations)

        Protecting Your Data
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        As with other utilities that employ Python's shutil module to carry out high-level
        file operations, proceeding with caution and creating a backup
        of your data prior to use is strongly recommended.
        
        
        Operating System
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Old Folder is intended to be operating system independent, but has so far only
        been tested on Windows.
