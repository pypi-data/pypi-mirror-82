All component and connection property equations derive from balance equations
for fluid composition, mass flow and energy in regarding thermal as well as
hydraulic state and thermodynamic fluid property equations respectively.
Standard literature is for example :cite:`Baehr2016,Epple2012,Bswirth2012`
(german). Equations and properties from other sources are cited individually.
