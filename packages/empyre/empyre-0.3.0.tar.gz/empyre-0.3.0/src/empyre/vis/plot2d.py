def imshow(field, axis=None, cmap=None, **kwargs):
    """Display an image on a 2D regular raster. Wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : `Field` or ndarray
        The image data as a `Field` or a numpy array (in the latter case, `vector=False` and `scale=1.0` are assumed).
    axis : `matplotlib.axes.Axes` object, optional
        The axis to which the image should be added, by default None, which will pick the last use axis via `gca`.
    cmap : str or `matplotlib.colors.Colormap`, optional
        The Colormap that should be used for the display, either as a string or object, by default None, which will pick
        `cmocean.cm.balance` if available. `imshow` will automatically detect if a divergent colormap is used and will
        make sure that zero is pinned to the symmetry point of the colormap (this is done by creating a new colormap
        with custom range under the hood).

    Returns
    -------
    axis : `matplotlib.axes.Axes`
        The plotting axis.

    Notes
    -----
    Additional kwargs are passed to :meth:`~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`.
    Note that the y-axis of the plot is flipped in comparison to :meth:`~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`, i.e. that the
    origin is `'lower'` in this case instead of `'upper'`.
    Uses the `empyre-image` stylesheet settings for plotting (and axis creation if none exists, yet).
    Fields are squeezed before plotting, so non-2D fields work as long as their superfluous dimensions have length 1.

    In-plane directions are encoded via hue ("color wheel"), making sure that all in-plane directions are isoluminant
    (i.e. a greyscale image would result a homogeneously medium grey image). Out-of-plane directions are encoded via
    brightness with upwards pointing vectors being white and downward pointing vectors being black. The length of the
    vectors are encoded via saturation, with full saturation being fully chromatic (in-plane) or fully white/black
    (up/down). The center of the "color sphere" desaturated in a medium gray and encodes vectors with length zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : `Field` or ndarray
        The image data as a `Field` or a numpy array (in the latter case, `vector=True` and `scale=1.0` are assumed).

    Fields are squeezed before plotting, so non-2D fields work as long as their superfluous dimensions have length 1.
    Even though squeezing takes place, `colorvec` "remembers" the original orientation of the slice! This is important
    if you want to plot a slice that should not represent the xy-plane. The colors chosen will respect the original
    orientation of your slice, e.g. a vortex in the xz-plane will include black and white colors (up/down) if the
    `Field` object given as the `field` parameter has `dim=(128, 1, 128)`. If you want to plot a slice of a 3D vector
    with 3 components and make use of this functionality, make sure to not use an integer as an index, as that will
    drop the dimension BEFORE it is passed to `colorvec`, which will have no way of knowing which dimension was dropped.
    Instead, make sure to use a slice of length one (example with `dim=(128, 128, 128)`):
    >>> colorvec(field[:, 15, :])  # Wrong! Shape: (128, 128), interpreted as xy-plane!
    >>> colorvec(field[:, 15:16, :])  # Right! Shape: (128, 1, 128), passed as 3D to `colorvec`, squeezed internally!

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : `Field` or ndarray
        The vector data as a `Field` or a numpy array (in the latter case, `vector=True` and `scale=1.0` are assumed).
    axis : `matplotlib.axes.Axes` object, optional
        The axis to which the image should be added, by default None, which will pick the last use axis via `gca`.
    color_angles : bool, optional
        Switch that turns on color encoding of the arrows, by default False. Encoding works the same as for the
        `colorvec` function (see for details). If False, arrows are uniformly colored white with black border. In both
        cases, the amplitude is encoded via the transparency of the arrow.
    cmap : str or `matplotlib.colors.Colormap`, optional
        The Colormap that should be used for the arrows, either as a string or object, by default None. Will only be
        used if `color_angles=True`.
    n_bin : float or 'auto', optional
        Number of entries along each axis over which the average is taken, by default 'auto', which automatically
        determines a bin size resulting in roughly 16 arrows along the largest dimension. Usually sensible to leave
        this on to not clutter the image with too many arrows (also due to performance). Can be turned off by setting
        `n_bin=1`. Uses the `..fields.field.Field.bin` method.
    bin_with_mask : bool, optional
        If True (default) and if `n_bin>1`, entries of the constructed binned `Field` that averaged over regions that
        were outside the `..fields.field.Field.mask` will not be assigned an arrow and stay empty instead. This prevents
        errouneous "fade-out" effects of the arrows that would occur even for homogeneous objects.

    Even though squeezing takes place, `quiver` "remembers" the original orientation of the slice and which dimensions
    were squeezed! See `colorvec` for  more information and an example (the same principles apply here, too).
    The transparency of the arrows denotes the 3D(!) amplitude, if you see dots in the plot, that means the amplitude
    is not zero, but simply out of the current plane!
