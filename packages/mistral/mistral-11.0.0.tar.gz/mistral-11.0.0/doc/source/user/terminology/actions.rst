Actions
=======

Actions are a particular instruction associated with a task that will be
performed when the task runs. For instance: running a shell script, making an
HTTP request, or sending a signal to an external system. Actions can be
synchronous or asynchronous.

With synchronous actions, Mistral will send a signal to the Mistral Executor
and wait for a result. Once the Executor completes the action, the result will
be sent to the Mistral Engine.

With asynchronous actions, Mistral will send a signal to a third party service
and wait for a corresponding action result to be delivered back via the Mistral
API. Once the signal has been sent, Mistral isn't responsible for the state and
result of the action. The third-party service should send a request to the
Mistral API and provide information corresponding to the *action execution* and
its state and result.

System actions
--------------

System actions are provided by Mistral out of the box and are available to all
users. Additional actions can be added via the custom action plugin mechanism.

Ad-hoc actions
--------------

Ad-hoc actions are defined in YAML files by users. They wrap existing actions
and their main goal is to simplify using the same action multiple times.  For
example, if the same HTTP request is used in multiple workflows, it can be
defined in one place and then re-used without the need to duplicate all of the
parameters.

.. note::

    Nested ad-hoc actions (i.e. ad-hoc actions wrapping around other ad-hoc
    actions) are not currently supported.
