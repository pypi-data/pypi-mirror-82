So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Mistral.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* IRC channel #openstack-mistral at FreeNode
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[mistral]`` for faster responses)
  http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-discuss

Contacting the Core Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * Renat Akhmerov, PTL (#rakhmerov)
   * Eyal Bar-Ilan (#eyalb)
   * Oleg Ovcharuk (#vgvoleg)
   * Andras Kovi (#akovi)
   * Adriano Petrich (#apetrich)

New Feature Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to add new functionality to Mistral please file a blueprint
by following https://blueprints.launchpad.net/mistral/+addspec

We don't have a strict requirement to write a detailed specification for
all new features and rather encourage more agile approach: just file a
brief description of a feature in the form of blueprint and then send a
patch to review (linking it to the blueprint). However, in some rare cases,
like proposing new API or workflow language additions, we need a spec so
that the team could fully understand what's going to be done and provide
a feedback.

To file a specification for a new feature, send a patch to
https://opendev.org/openstack/mistral-specs that adds a new spec file
for the needed release cycle (e.g. 'specs/victoria')

The full list of the specs can be seen at
https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/mistral-specs/

Task Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We track our tasks in Launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral

If you're looking for some smaller, easier work item to pick up and get started
on, search for the 'low-hanging-fruit' tag.

Reporting a Bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You found an issue and want to make sure we are aware of it? You can do so on
`Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral>`_.
