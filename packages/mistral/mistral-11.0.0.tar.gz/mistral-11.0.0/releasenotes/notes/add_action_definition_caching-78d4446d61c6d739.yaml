    Enable caching of action definitions in local memory. Now, instead of
    downloading the definitions from the database every time, mistral engine
    will store them in a local cache. This should reduce the number of
    database requests and improve the whole performance of the system.
    Cache ttl can be configured with ``action_definition_cache_time`` option
    from [engine] group. The default value is 60 seconds.
