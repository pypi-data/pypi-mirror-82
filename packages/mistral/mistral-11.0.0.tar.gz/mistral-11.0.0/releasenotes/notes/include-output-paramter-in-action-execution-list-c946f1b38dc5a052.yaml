    New parameter called 'include_output' added to action execution api.
    By default output field does not return when calling list action executions
    API

critical:
  - |

    By default, output field will not return when calling list action
    executions. In the previous version it did, so if a user used this, and/or
    wants to get output field when calling list action executions API, it will
    be possible only by using the new include output parameter.
