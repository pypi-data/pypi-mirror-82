    Add support for creating ad-hoc actions in a namespace. Creating actions
    with same name is now possible inside the same project now. This feature
    is backward compatible.

    All existing actions are assumed to be in the default namespace,
    represented by an empty string. Also, if an action is created without a
    namespace specified, it is assumed to be in the default namespace.

    If an ad-hoc action is created inside a workbook, then the namespace of the workbook
    would be also it's namespace.
