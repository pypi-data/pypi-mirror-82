fixes:
  - When we pass a workflow environment to workflow parameters
    using 'env' Mistral first evaluates it assuming that it
    can contain expressions (YAQL/Jinja) For example, one
    environment variable can be expressed through the other.
    In some cases it causes problems. For example, if the
    environment is too big and has many expressions, especially
    something like <% $ %> or <% env() %>. Also, in some cases
    we don't want any evaluations to happen if we want to
    have some informative text in the environment containing
    expressions.
    In order to address that the 'evaluate_env' workflow parameter
    was added, defaulting to True for backwards compatibility.
    If it's set to False then it disables evaluation of
    expressions in the environment.
