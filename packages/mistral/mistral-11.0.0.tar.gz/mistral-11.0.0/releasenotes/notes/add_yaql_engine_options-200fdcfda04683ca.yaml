features:
  - |
    Added several config options that allow to tweak some aspects of the YAQL
    engine behavior.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed how Mistral initializes a child YAQL context before evaluating
    YAQL expressions. The given data context needs to go through a special
    filter that prepares the data properly, does conversion into internal
    types etc. Also, without this change YAQL engine options are not applied
    properly.
