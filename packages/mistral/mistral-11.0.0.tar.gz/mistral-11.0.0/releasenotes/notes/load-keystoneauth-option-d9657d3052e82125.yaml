    A new config option section `[keystone]` is added. The options in the
    section is from keystoneauth by default. Please use them to talk with
    keystone session. If the option value is not set, to keep backward
    compatibility, Mistral will read the value from the same option in
    `[keystone_authtoken]`.

    The override behvaior will be removed in Stein. Please update the options
    into `[keystone]` if you still want to use them.
