    Added HTTPProxyToWSGI middleware in front of the Mistral API.
    The purpose of this middleware is to set up the request URL correctly in
    the case there is a proxy (for instance, a loadbalancer such as HAProxy)
    in front of the Mistral API.
    The HTTPProxyToWSGI is off by default and needs to be enabled via a
    configuration value.
    Fixes [`bug 1590608 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral/+bug/1590608>`_]
    Fixes [`bug 1816364 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral/+bug/1816364>`_]
