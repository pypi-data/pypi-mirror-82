    The header X-Target-Insecure previously accepted any string and used it
    for comparisons. This meant unless it was empty (or not provided) it would
    always evaluate as True. This change makes the validation stricter, only
    accepting "True" and "False" and converting these to boolean values. Any
    other value will return an error.
