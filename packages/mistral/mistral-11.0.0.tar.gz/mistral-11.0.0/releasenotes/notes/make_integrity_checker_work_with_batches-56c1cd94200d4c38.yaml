    Workflow execution integrity checker mechanism was too aggressive in case
    of big workflows that have many task executions in RUNNING state at the
    same time. The mechanism was selecting them all in one query and calling
    "on_action_complete" for each of them within a single DB transaction.
    That could lead to situations when this mechanism would totally block
    all normal workflow processing whereas it should only be a "last chance"
    aid in case of real infrastructure failures (e.g. MQ outage).
    This issue has been fixed by adding a configurable batch size, so that
    the checker can't select more than this number of task executions in
    RUNNING state at once.
