fixes:
  - Fixed the logic of the 'pause' command. Before the fix Mistral wouldn't
    run any commands specified in 'on-success', 'on-error' and 'on-complete'
    clauses following after the 'pause' command when a workflow was resumed
    after it. Now it works as expected. If Mistral encounters 'pause' in the
    list of commands it saves all commands following after it to the special
    backlog storage and when/if the workflow is later resumed it checks that
    storage and runs commands from it first.
