    There has been a big change in the Mistral action management. All Mistral
    subsystems don't access the database directly if they need to work with
    action definitions. Instead, they work action providers registered in
    the new entry point "mistral.action.providers". All action providers need
    to implement the base class ActionProvider declared in "mistral-lib"
    starting with the version 2.3.0. Action providers are responsible for
    delivering so-called action descriptors that carry all the most important
    information about particular actions like "name", "description", names
    of input parameters and so on. The entire system has now been refactored
    with action providers. Using this new mechanism it's now possible to
    deliver actions into the system dynamically w/o having to reboot Mistral.
    We just need to come up with an action provider implementation that can
    do that and register it in the entry point from any Python project
    installed on the same Python environment.
    This approach also means that actions don't have to be stored in the
    database anymore. It fully depends on a particular action provider how
    to store action descriptors and how to perform lookup. It is possible
    to create action providers fetching information about actions over
    HTTP, AMQP and potentially any other protocol.
    Additionally, switching to action providers allowed to make engine code
    much cleaner and more encapsulated. For example, ad-hoc actions are no
    longer a concern of the Mistral engine. Instead of implementing all
    ad-hoc action logic in the engine there's now a special action provider
    fully responsible for ad-hoc actions.
    The detailed documentation on using action providers will be added soon.

    As part of the transition to action providers the compatibility of the
    /actions REST API endpoint has been broken to some extent. For ad-hoc
    actions it remained almost the same. We still can do all CRUD operations
    upon them. However, all the standard actions (prefixed with "std.") are
    not stored in the DB anymore. For that reason this type of actions doesn't
    have IDs anymore, and generally actions are not identified by IDs anymore,
    only by name. This change needs to be taken into account when updating
    to this version of Mistral.
