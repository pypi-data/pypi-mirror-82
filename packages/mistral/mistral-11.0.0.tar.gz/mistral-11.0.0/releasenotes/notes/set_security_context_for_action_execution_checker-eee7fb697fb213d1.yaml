    Action execution checker didn't set a security context before failing
    expired action executions. It caused ApplicationContextNotFoundException
    in case if corresponding workflow specification was not in the cache and
    Mistral had to load a DB object. The DB operation in turn was trying
    to access a security context which wasn't set. It's now fixed by setting
    an admin context in the action execution checker thread.
