fixes:
  - Mistral was storing, in fact, two copies of a workflow environment,
    one in workflow parameters (the 'params' field) and another one in
    a context (the 'context' field). Now it's stored only in workflow
    parameters. It saves space in DB and increases performance in case
    of big workflow environments.
  - Mistral was copying a workflow environment into all of their sub
    workflows. In case of a big workflow environment and a big number
    of sub workflows it caused serious problems, used additional space
    in DB and used a lot of RAM (e.g. when the 'on-success' clause has
    a lot of tasks where each one of them is a subworkflow). Now it is
    fixed by evaluating a workflow environment through the root execution
    reference.
