    If an action execution fails but returns a result as a list (error=[])
    the result of this action is assigned to the task execution 'state_info'
    field which is a string according to the DB model. On Python 3 it this
    list magically converts to a string. On Python 2.7 it doesn't. The reason
    is probably in how SQLAlchemy works on different versions of Python. This
    has now been fixed with an explicit type coercion.
