    Workflow and join completion check logic is now simplified with using
    post transactional queue of operations which is a more generic version of
    action_queue module previously serving for scheduling action runs outside
    of the main DB transaction. Workflow completion check is now registered
    only once when a task completes which reduces clutter and it's registered
    only if the task may potentially lead to workflow completion.
