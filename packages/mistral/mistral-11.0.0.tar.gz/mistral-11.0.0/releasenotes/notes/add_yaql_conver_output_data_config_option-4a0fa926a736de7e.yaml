    Added the configuration option "convert_output_data" in the "yaql" group.
    This option, if set to False, allows to disable YAQL expression result
    conversion. This fixes performance issues for lots of use cases where
    a result of an expression is a big data structure. In fact, YAQL created
    a copy of this data structure every time before giving it to Mistral.
    This option can't be set to False when the corresponding
    "convert_input_data" is True. Otherwise, it doesn't work correctly.
    By default, the value of "convert_output_data" is True which keeps
    backwards compatibility.
