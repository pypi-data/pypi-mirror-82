    Added the "convert_input_data" config property under the "yaql" group.
    By default it's set to True which preserves the current behavior so
    there's no risk with compatibility. If set to False, it disables the
    additional data conversion that was initially added to support some
    tricky cases like working with sets of dicts (although dict is not a
    hashable type and can't be put into a set). Disabling it give a
    significant performance boost in cases when data contexts are very
    large.
