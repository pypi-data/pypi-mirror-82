    Eliminated an unnecessary update of the workflow execution object
    when processing "on_action_complete" operation. W/o this fix all
    such transactions would have to compete for the workflow executions
    table that causes lots of DB deadlocks (on MySQL) and transaction
    retries. In some cases the number of retries even exceeds the limit
    (currently hardcoded 50) and such tasks can be fixed only with the
    integrity checker over time.
