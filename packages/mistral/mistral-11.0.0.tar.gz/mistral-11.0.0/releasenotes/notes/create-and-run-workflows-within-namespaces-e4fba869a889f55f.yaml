    Creating and running workflows within a namespace. Workflows with the same
    name can be added to the same project as long as they are within a
    different namespace. This feature is backwards compatible.

    All existing workflows are assumed to be in the default namespace,
    represented by an empty string. Also if a workflow is created without a
    namespace spcified, it is assumed to be in the default namespace.

    When a workflow is being executed, the namespace is saved under params and
    passed to all its sub workflow executions. When looking for the next
    sub-workflow to run, the correct workflow will be found by name and
    namespace, where the namespace can be the workflow namespace or the default
    namespace. Workflows in the same namespace as the top workflow will be
    given a higher priority.
