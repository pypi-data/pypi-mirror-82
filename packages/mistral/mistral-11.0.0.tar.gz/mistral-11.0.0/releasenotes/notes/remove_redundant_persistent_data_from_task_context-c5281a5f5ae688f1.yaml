fixes:
  - Mistral was storing some internal information in task execution
    inbound context ('task_executions_v2.in_contex' DB field) to DB.
    This information was needed only to correctly implement the YAQL
    function task() without arguments. A fix was made to not store
    this information in the persistent storage and rather include it
    into a context view right before evaluating expressions where
    needed. So it slightly optimizes spaces in DB.
