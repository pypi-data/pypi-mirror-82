    Some users rely on the presence of the root error related to
    running an action and it's not convenient that it is now in
    the end of the string, e.g. if we look at the corresponding
    task execution "state_info" field. Now a cause error message
    is included in the beginning of the resulting error string
    returned by the action executor so that it's clearly visible.
    This message can be also truncated in some cases (depending on
    the config option) so we need to make sure we keep the cause
    error message.
