    For an ad-hoc action, preparing input for its base action was done more
    than once. It happened during the validation phase and the scheduling
    phase. However, input preparation may be expensive in case of heavy
    expressions and data contexts. This has now been fixed by caching a
    prepared input within an AdHocAction instance.
