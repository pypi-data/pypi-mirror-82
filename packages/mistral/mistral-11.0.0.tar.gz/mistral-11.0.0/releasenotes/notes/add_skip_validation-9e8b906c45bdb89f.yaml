    The new configuration option "validation_mode" was added. It can take one
    of the values: "enabled", "mandatory", "disabled". If it is set to
    "enabled" then Mistral will be validating the workflow language syntax
    for all API operations that create or update workflows (either via
    /v2/workflows or /v2/workbooks) unless it's explicitly disabled with the
    API parameter "skip_validation" that has now been added to the
    corresponding API endpoints. The "skip_validation" parameter doesn't have
    to have any value since it's a boolean flag. If the configuration option
    "validation_mode" is set to "mandatory" then Mistral will be always
    validating the syntax of all workflows for the mentioned operations.
    If set to "disabled" then validation will always be skipped. Note that
    if validation is disabled (one way or another) then there's a risk of
    breaking a workflow unexpectedly while it's running or getting another an
    unexpected error when uploading it possible w/o a user-friendly description
    of the error.
