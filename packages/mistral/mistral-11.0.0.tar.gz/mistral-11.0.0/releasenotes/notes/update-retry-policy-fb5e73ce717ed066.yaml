critical:
    - Due to bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral/+bug/1631140,
      Mistral was not considering retry with value 1. After this bug is
      fixed, Mistral now considers count value 1 as a value for retry.
    - Mistral does not consider the initial task run as a retry but
      only considers the retry value after the failure of initial task
      execution.
