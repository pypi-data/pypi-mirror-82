    Mistral now support policy in code, which means if users didn't modify
    any of policy rules, they can leave policy file (in `json` or `yaml`
    format) empty or just remove it all together. Because from now, Mistral
    keeps all default policies under `mistral/policies` module. Users can
    still modify/generate `policy.yaml` file which will override policy
    rules in code if those rules show in `policy.yaml` file.

    Default `policy.json` file is now removed as Mistral now generate the
    default policies in code. Please be aware that when using that file in your
    environment.
