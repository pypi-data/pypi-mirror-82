    Add support for creating workbooks in a namespace. Creating workbooks
    with same name is now possible inside the same project now. This feature
    is backward compatible.

    All existing workbooks are assumed to be in the default namespace,
    represented by an empty string. Also, if a workbook is created without a
    namespace specified, it is assumed to be in the default namespace.

    When a workbook is created, its namespace is inherited by the
    workflows contained within it. All operations on a particular workbook
    require combination of name and namespace to uniquely identify a workbook
    inside a project.
