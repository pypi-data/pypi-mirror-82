        Pytorch support for Knitro
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To set up your local development environment, please use a fresh virtual environment.
        
        Then run:
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
        
        You can now import functions and classes from the module with `import knitropytorch`.
        
        ### Testing
        
        We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run
        
            pytest
        
        To run the tests with coverage information, please use
        
            python setup.py testcov
        
        and have a look at the `htmlcov` folder, after the tests are done.
