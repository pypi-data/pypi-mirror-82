The grossup consists of including due taxes and service fee into a given
principal augmenting it so its resulting net value equals the originally given
principal.

It seems fairly reasonable to assume the service fee is simply an aliquot
applied over the principal so, if :math:`S` is the principal and :math:`\gamma` is
the service fee aliquot, then the service fee given by :math:`\gamma S`.

On the other hand, it is hard to pin down a reasonable and generic expression
for due taxes, since they are very context bound and their rules might be
revised as laws are amended.
