# privGAN
This repository contains the source code for PrivGan - a novel approach for deterring membership inference attacks on GAN generated synthetic medical data.Currently, the repository contains the jupyter notebooks for various datasets. We will be converting the code into a library in the future.
Please visit our paper 'PrivGAN: Protecting GANs from membership inference attacks at low cost' [ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00071) submitted at PETS 2021
