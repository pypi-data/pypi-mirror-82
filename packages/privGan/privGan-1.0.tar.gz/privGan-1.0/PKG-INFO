Description: This repository contains the source code for PrivGan - a novel approach     for deterring membership inference attacks on GAN generated synthetic medical data.Currently,     the repository contains the jupyter notebooks for various datasets. We will be converting     the code into a library in the future. Please visit our paper     "PrivGAN: Protecting GANs from membership inference attacks at low cost" [ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00071) submitted at PETS 2021.
