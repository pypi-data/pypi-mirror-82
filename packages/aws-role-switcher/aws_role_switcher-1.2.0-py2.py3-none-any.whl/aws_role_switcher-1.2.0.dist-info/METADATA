# aws_role_switcher

This is a CLI application makes it easier to switch roles using auto completion from parsing your aws config/credential file and setting `"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN", "AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN"` environment variables if present.

This script does not support MFA roles, and designed to help cycle through profiles set manually, or as output from an SSO script like: https://github.com/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds
## Installation
```python3 -m pip install -U aws_role_switcher```

In order to work properly this script must be sourced, add the following to your .profile or .bashrc( you can adjust the alias name to whatever you want)
```alias ars='source aws-role-switcher.sh'```

Note: You can run this from the command line using `. aws-role-switcher.sh` or `source aws-role-switcher.sh`.

## Configuration
You can set the following environmental variables:

`AWS_PROFILE_SWITCHER_PATH` - Override the default credential/config file location from `$HOME/.aws/credentials`

 I would recommend adding to your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile



## Example Usage

`ars` to start prompt. TAB or start typing to start auto completion list. TAB or use arrows to cycle through list, and enter to select.

Example config file:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = REDACTED
aws_secret_access_key = redacted
aws_session_token = default
aws_security_token = default

[testing-administrator]
aws_access_key_id = REDACTED
aws_secret_access_key = redacted
aws_session_token = testing
aws_security_token = testing


[staging-administrator]
aws_access_key_id = REDACTED
aws_secret_access_key = redacted
aws_session_token = staging
aws_security_token = staging


[production-administrator]
aws_access_key_id = REDACTED
aws_secret_access_key = redacted
aws_session_token = production
aws_security_token = production

```
