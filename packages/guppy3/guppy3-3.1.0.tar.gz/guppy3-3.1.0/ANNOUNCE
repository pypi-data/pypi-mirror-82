I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.1.0

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

This is a major feature release. The main news in this release:

o Python 3.9 support, without subinterpreter support or inter-interpreter
  traversal.
o Added .byprod classifier via tracemalloc, and .prod to print thracemalloc
  traceback.
o Added .all to print all lines in a MorePrinter buffer.
o Added R_INSET relation for being contained by an unordered set.
