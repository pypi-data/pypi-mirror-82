    When a single resource provider receives many concurrent allocation writes,
    retries may be performed server side when there is a resource provider
    generation conflict. When those retries are all consumed, the client
    receives an HTTP 409 response and may choose to try the request again.

    In an environment where high levels of concurrent allocation writes are
    common, such as a busy clustered hypervisor, the default retry count may be
    too low. See story 2006467_

    A new configuation setting,
    ``[placement]/allocation_conflict_retry_count``, has been added to address
    this situation. It defines the number of times to retry, server-side,
    writing allocations when there is a resource provider generation conflict.
