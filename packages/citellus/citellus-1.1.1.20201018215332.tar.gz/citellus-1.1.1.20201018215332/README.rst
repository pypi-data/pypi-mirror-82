Introduction
============

Citellus is a framework to help with system configuration validation on
either live system or any sort of snapshot of the filesystem.

Via execution of 'plugins' it reports status on each one execution
against the system that gives you an idea on health status, actual
problems or problems that will reveal themselves if no preventive action
is taken.
