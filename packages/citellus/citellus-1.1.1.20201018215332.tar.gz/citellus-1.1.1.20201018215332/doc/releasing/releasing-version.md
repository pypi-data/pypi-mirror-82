## Generate a new release

For generating a new release on github and PyPI:

Go to Git Hub, then to Releases and draft a new release:

For example, to release version 1.1.0:

- Define the new release, text and tag it as '1.1.0'
- GitHub Actions will pick this new generated release and upload package to PyPI for later usage automatically
