## Introduction

This extension allows to define files that must be outputed to stderr as metadata source.

## How to add a new file to monitor

- Create a new text file in the folder (try recreating path or context in path) so include/exclude filters do also work

- Inside that file introduce same tags as other plugins:
  - bugzilla: URL of the bug containing info if any
  - long_name: Long name of the file
  - priority: how likely is this to be a big problem in the environment
  - description: Description of the file to monitor
  - path: Path to the file to check, if it contains CITELLUS_ROOT it's for snapshot mode.
  - If text CITELLUS_HYBRID is found, the file path is valid for both live and not live (use CITELLUS_ROOT and it will be "" for live execution)
