## Writing extensions

Citellus extensions should conform to the following standards:

- Written in python and stored in the `extensions` folder.
- Implement some base functions keeping arguments and data returned as in others:
  - init()
    - Returns list of triggers (array with strings)
  - listplugins(options)
    - Yields plugin object generator based on `options.include`, `options.exclude`
  - get_description(plugin)
    - Returns string for description based on pluging object
  - run(plugin)
    - Returns (returncode, out, err) after running a plugin object
  - help()
    - Returns string with description of extension
- Define extension in listplugins as 'backend' based on the name of the file, so findplugins, runplugin, etc can find it properly and execute.
