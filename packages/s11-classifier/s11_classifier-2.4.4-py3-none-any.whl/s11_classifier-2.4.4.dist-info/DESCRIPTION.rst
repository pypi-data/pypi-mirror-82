# Classifier

A scalable land cover classification tool for humans

Go to [the documentation](https://satelligence.gitlab.io/classifier) for more
 info on how to install and run Classifier!

## Note on performance

For now, the multithreading of XGboost is not properly implemented. If you have
a lot of input files the XGBoost method is MUCH slower than e.g. scikit-learn's
random forest. With single input files (so not a lot of IO operations), the
difference in performance is small.
