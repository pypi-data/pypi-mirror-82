The package 'basic_distributions' contains one meain class and two subclasses to create an manage Gaussian distributions and Binomial distributions.

The classes can be created with provided data in list format loaded with one of the methods

Main Class:
- Distribution: contains methods to iniciate the class and assign a mean and standard deviation, and to load data

Sublasses:
- Gaussian: inherites from Distrbution and has methods to compute mean and standard deviation, plot histograms, and add Gaussian distributions
- Binomial: inherites from Distributions nad has methods to compute mean and standard deviations, plot  and add Binomial distributions
