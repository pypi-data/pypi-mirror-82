|PyPi Version| |Build Status| |Documentation Status| |Black|

This is a heavily modified fork of `rhyst/idasen-controller`_.

The IDÃ…SEN is an electric sitting standing desk with a Linak controller sold by
ikea.

The position of the desk can controlled by a physical switch on the desk or
via bluetooth using an phone app.

This is a command line interface written in python to control the Idasen via
bluetooth from a desktop computer.

Set Up
******

Prerequisites
=============

The desk should be connected and paired to the computer.

Install
=======

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade idasen


Developers Install
==================

Development is done with `poetry`_, a virtual environment manager.
First, `install poetry`_ using their guide.

Then install all the packages using poetry install:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry install

To install this as a command available from the system build the package then
install it with pip:


.. code-block:: bash

    poetry build
    python3.8 -m pip install dist/idasen-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl

Configuration
*************
Configuration that is not expected to change frequency can be provided via a
YAML configuration file located at ``~/.config/idasen/idasen.yaml``.

You can use this command to initialize a new configuartion file:

.. code-block:: bash

    idasen init

Configuartion options:

* ``mac_address`` - The MAC address of the desk. This is required.
* ``stand_height`` - The standing height from the floor of the desk in meters.
* ``sit_height`` - The standing height from the floor of the desk in meters.

The program will try to find the device address, but if it fails, it has to be done manually.
Device MAC addresses can be found using ``blueoothctl`` and bluetooth adapter
names can be found with ``hcitool dev`` on linux.

Usage
*****

Command Line
============

To print the current desk height:

.. code-block:: bash

    idasen height

To monitor for changes to height :

.. code-block:: bash

    idasen monitor

Assuming the config file is populated to move the desk to standing position:

.. code-block:: bash

    idasen stand

Assuming the config file is populated to move the desk to sitting position:

.. code-block:: bash

    idasen sit
