# GRR client approval rules
#
# When using the FullAccessControlManager users are required to obtain an
# approval from another user to access a client. By default any user can approve
# any client.
#
# This file allows you to customize approvals that are required for clients. We
# specify approvers for labels here such that if a client has labels
# "legal_approval" and "prod_admin_approval" approvals are required from a user
# listed in both those label groups.
#
# The prod_admin_approval group also requires the requester (i.e. the person who
# will get access) to also be one of the users listed, AND at least two other
# people from that group to approve.
#
# Examples:
#
#label: "legal_approval"
#users:
#  - "legal1"
#  - "legal2"
#---
#label: "prod_admin_approval"
#requester_must_be_authorized: True
#num_approvers_required: 2
#users:
#  - "prod1"
#  - "prod2"
#  - "prod3"
