Description: # Three60Cube
        
        A Package to project a 360 x 180 image onto a cube.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install three60cube
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Creation of projection template
        ```
        from three30cube import Three60Cube
        
        proj = Three60Cube('source.JPG')
        ```
        This will write a `npy` file to your working directory. To get the projection on a certain cube pane:
        
        ```
        new_img = proj.get_projected_pane(pane=1, dim=500)
        new_img
        ```
        
        Panes 0 through 3 are taken from the left to right side of the 360 image. Pane 4 is the top of the cube and pane 5 is the bottom part. The `dim` parameter refers to dimension of the output image; a `dim` of 500 will produce a 500 x 500px image.
        
        After you have generated the npy-template you can process images with the same dimensions of the initial 360 image:
        
        ```
        # use the generated template if you have one and haven't 
        # initialized a Three60Cube object already 
        proj = Three60Cube(template='three60cube_template.npy')
        
        # open an image
        proj.open_image('trees.JPG')
        
        # project
        new_img = proj.get_projected_pane(pane=0, dim=500)
        ```
        
        ### Fast vs Slow
        
        The `get_projected_pane` function takes a parameter `fast` (default value is True) that will project single RGB on the cube. If `fast` is set to False it will collect all RGB values of all pixels that are projected on a single pixel of the cube and sets its RGB value to the average of the collected values. Thanks to [qubixes](https://github.com/qubixes) this won't take a lot of time.
