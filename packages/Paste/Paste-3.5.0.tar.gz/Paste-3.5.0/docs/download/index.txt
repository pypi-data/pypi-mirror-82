Downloads
=========

Each of these packages is available in several formats.  The source
distribution is a complete set of documentation, tests, and the source
files themselves.  There are also two "Egg" files: these are files
`easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_
can install directly into your ``site-packages/`` directory, and are
Python-version specific.  The download files for the latest version
are always located on the Cheese Shop pages (listed below).

* `Paste <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Paste>`_
* `Paste Script <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PasteScript>`_
* `Paste Deploy <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PasteDeploy>`_
* `Paste WebKit <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PasteWebKit>`_
* `Wareweb <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Wareweb>`_ (deprecated, use `Pylons
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pylons>`_ instead)

All the packages are available in some repositories, many rooted in
http://bitbucket.org/ianb/

* https://github.com/cdent/paste
* http://bitbucket.org/ianb/pastescript
* http://bitbucket.org/ianb/pastedeploy
* https://github.com/Pylons/webob
* ... and others

..note:: Several of these repositories and projects are fairly stale and
         insufficiently maintained. Work is in progress to get them on
         life support, but it is unlikely they will ever be active projects
         again. WebOb is still actively maintained.
