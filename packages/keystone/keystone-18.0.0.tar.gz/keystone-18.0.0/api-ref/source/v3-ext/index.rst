=============
Relationships
=============

The entries within the operations below contain a relationship link, which
appears as a valid URI, however these are actually
URN (Uniform Resource Name), which are similar to GUID except it uses a URI
syntax so that it is easier to be read. These links do not resolve to
anything valid, but exist to show a relationship.
