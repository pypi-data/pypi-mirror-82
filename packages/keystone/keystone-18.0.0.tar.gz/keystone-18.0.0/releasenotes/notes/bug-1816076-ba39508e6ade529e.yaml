    `GET /v3/users/{user_id}` now returns a federated object associated with
    the user if any. `POST /v3/users` allows an operator to add a list of
    federated objects to associate with the user. `PATCH /v3/users` allows the operator
    to update a users associated federated objects.

    If you have a custom implementation for the shadow users backend, you will
    need to implement the new methods:
    ``delete_federated_object``, ``create_federated_object``,
    ``get_federated_objects``. These methods are needed to support federated
    attributes via the user API.
