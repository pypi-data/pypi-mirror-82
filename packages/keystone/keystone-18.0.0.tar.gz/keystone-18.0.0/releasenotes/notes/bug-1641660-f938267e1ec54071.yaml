    about the user that initiated the request.

    The default value for ``[DEFAULT] notification_opt_out`` has been changed
    to include: ``identity.authenticate.success``, ``identity.authenticate.pending``
    and ``identity.authenticate.failed``. If a deployment relies on these
    notifications, then override the default setting.
