    [`blueprint domain-level-limit <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/domain-level-limit>`_]
    Keystone now supports domain level unified limit. When creating a limit,
    users can specify a ``domain_id`` instead of ``project_id``. For `flat`
    model, the domain limit is still non-hierarchical. For `strict-two-level`
    model, the domain limit is now considered as the first level, so that the
    project limit is the second level and the project can't contain any child.
