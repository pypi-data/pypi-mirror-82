    The default value of the config option `unique_last_password_count` is
    changed from 1 to 0. Now `unique_last_password_count = 0` means password
    history check is disabled. `unique_last_password_count = 1` means
    when changing password, the new one should be different than the current
    one.

    Please note that the deployment which sets `unique_last_password_count = 1`
    in the config file should update the value to 0 to keep the same behavior
    as before.
