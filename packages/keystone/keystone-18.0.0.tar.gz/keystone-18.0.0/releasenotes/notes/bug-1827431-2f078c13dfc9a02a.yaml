    [`bug 1827431 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1827431>`_]
    Added a new user option 'ignore_user_inactivity' (defaults to False).
    When set to True, it overrides disabling the user after being inactive
    for certain time as set in
    ``[security_compliance]disable_user_account_days_inactive`` option
    in Keystone configuration file.
