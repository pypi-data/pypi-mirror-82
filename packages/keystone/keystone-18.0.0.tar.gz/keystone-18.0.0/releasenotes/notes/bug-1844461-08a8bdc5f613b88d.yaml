    [`bug 1844461 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1844461>`_]
    Listing role assignments for a project subtree is now allowed by system
    readers and domain readers in addition to project admins.
upgrade:
  - |
    [`bug 1844461 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1844461>`_]
    The ``identity:list_role_assignments_for_subtree`` policy now allows system
    and domain readers to list role assignments for a project subtree and
    deprecates the old ``rule:admin_required`` policy check string.  Please
    consider the new policies if your deployment overrides role
    assignment policies.
deprecations:

    [`bug 1844461 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1844461>`_]
    The role assignment ``identity:list_role_assignments_for_subtree`` policy
    now uses ``(role:reader and system_scope:all) or (role:reader and
    domain_id:%(target.project.domain_id)s) or (role:admin and
    project_id:%(target.project.id)s)`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``.
    This new default automatically includes support for a read-only role
    and allows for more granular access to the role assignment API. Please
    consider this new default if your deployment overrides the role
    assignment policies.

    [`bug 1844461 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1844461>`_]
    Listing role assignments for a project subtree now uses system-scope,
    domain-scope, project-scope, and default roles to provide better
    accessbility to users in a secure way.
