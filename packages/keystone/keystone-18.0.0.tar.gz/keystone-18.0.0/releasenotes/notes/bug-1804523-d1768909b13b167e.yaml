    [`bug 1804523 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804523>`_]
    The federated protocol API uses new default policies that
    make it more accessible to end users and administrators. Please consider
    these new defaults if your deployment overrides federated protocol
    policies.
deprecations:

    [`bug 1804523 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804523>`_]
    The federated protocol policies have been deprecated. The
    ``identity:get_protocol`` and ``identity:list_protocols`` now use
    ``role:reader and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. The ``identity:create_protocol``,
    ``identity:update_protocol``, and ``identity:delete_protocol``
    policies now use ``role:admin and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. These new defaults automatically account
    for system-scope and support a read-only role, making it easier
    for system administrators to delegate subsets of responsibility
    without compromising security. Please consider these new defaults
    if your deployment overrides the federated protocol policies.
