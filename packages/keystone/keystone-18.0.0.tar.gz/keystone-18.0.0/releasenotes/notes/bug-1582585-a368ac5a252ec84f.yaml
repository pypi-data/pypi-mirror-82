    [`bug 1582585 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1582585>`_]
    A new method ``get_domain_mapping_list`` was added to
    ``keystone.identity.mapping_backends.base.MappingDriverBase``.

    Third-party extensions that extend the abstract class (``MappingDriverBase``)
    should implement this new method.

    The method has the following signature::

      get_domain_mapping_list(self, domain_id)

    and will return a list of mappings for a given domain ID.
