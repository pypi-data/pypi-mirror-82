deprecations:
  - >
    The option ``[token] infer_roles=False`` is being deprecated in favor of
    always expanding role implications during token validation.

    `Default roles <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/rocky/define-default-roles.html>`_
    depend on a chain of implied role assignments, ex: an admin user will also
    have the reader and member role. Therefore by ensuring that all these roles will
    always appear on the token validation response, we can improve the
    simplicity and readability of policy files.
