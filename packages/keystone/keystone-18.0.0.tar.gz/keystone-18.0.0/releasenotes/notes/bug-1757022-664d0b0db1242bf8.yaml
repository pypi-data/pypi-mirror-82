    [`bug 1757022 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1757022>`_]
    In previous releases,  ``keystone-manage mapping_purge --type {user,group}``
    command would purge all mapping incorrectly instead of only purging the
    specified type mappings. ``keystone-manage mapping_purge --type {user,group}``
    now purges only specified type mappings as expected.
