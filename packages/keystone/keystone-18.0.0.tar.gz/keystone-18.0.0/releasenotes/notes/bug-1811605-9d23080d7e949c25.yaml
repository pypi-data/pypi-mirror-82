    [`bug 1811605 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1811605>`_]
    Fixes X.509 tokenless auth by properly populating the request context
    with the necessary credential information. Since Stein release, RBAC
    has been using the credential information from the Keystone request
    context instead of the authentication context. Therefore, we'll need
    to populate the request context with the necessary credential
    information from the X.509 tokenless authentication context.
