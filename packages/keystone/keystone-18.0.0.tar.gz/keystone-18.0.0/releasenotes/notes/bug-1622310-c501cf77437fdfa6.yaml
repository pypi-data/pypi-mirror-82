    Trusts will now be invalidated if: the project to which the trust
    is scoped, or the user (trustor or trustee) for which the delegation
    is assigned, has been deleted.

    [`bug 1622310 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1622310>`_]
    A new method ``delete_trusts_for_project`` has been added to ``keystone.trust.backends.base.TrustDriverBase``.

    Third-party extensions that extend the abstract class (``TrustDriverBase``)
    should be updated according to the new parameter names.

    The signature for the new method is::

      delete_trusts_for_project(self, project_id)
