    [`bug 1789450 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1789450>`_]
    When a mapped group that does not exist in keystone is found, instead
    of throwing a 500 error, keystone will now log the instance and continue.
    This is expected behavior as an external IdP may specify a group that
    does not exist within keystone.
