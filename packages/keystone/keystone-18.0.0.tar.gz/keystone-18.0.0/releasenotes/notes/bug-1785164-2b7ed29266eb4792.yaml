    [`bug 1785164 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1785164>`_]
    Setting resource limits on domains is explicitly unsupported. Previously,
    it was possible to set a limit on a domain and the response would include
    the domain ID as the project ID of the limit. This issue has been corrected
    by explicitly opting domains out of limit support. A later release may
    include functionality for domains to be associated to limit resources.
