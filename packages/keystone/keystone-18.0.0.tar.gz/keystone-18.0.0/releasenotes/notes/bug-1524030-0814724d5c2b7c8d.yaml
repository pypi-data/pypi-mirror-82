    [`bug 1524030 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1524030>`_]
    Revocation records are no longer written to the ``revocation_event`` table
    when a domain or project is disabled. These records were only ever used
    during the token validation process. In favor of revocation events, the
    project or domain will be validated online when the token is validated. This
    results in less database bloat while maintaining security during token
    validation.
