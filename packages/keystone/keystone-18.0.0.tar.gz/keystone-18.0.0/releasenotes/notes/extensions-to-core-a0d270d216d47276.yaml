    The `keystone-paste.ini` file must be updated to remove extension
    filters, and their use in ``[pipeline:api_v3]``.
    Remove the following filters: ``[filter:oauth1_extension]``,
    ``[filter:federation_extension]``, ``[filter:endpoint_filter_extension]``,
    and ``[filter:revoke_extension]``. See the sample `keystone-paste.ini
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/keystone/src/branch/stable/rocky/etc/keystone-paste.ini>`_
    file for guidance.

    [`blueprint move-extensions <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/move-extensions>`_]
    If any extension migrations are run, for example: ``keystone-manage db_sync
    --extension endpoint_policy`` an error will be returned. This is working as
    designed. To run these migrations simply run: ``keystone-manage db_sync``.
    The complete list of affected extensions are: ``oauth1``, ``federation``,
    ``endpoint_filter``, ``endpoint_policy``, and ``revoke``.
