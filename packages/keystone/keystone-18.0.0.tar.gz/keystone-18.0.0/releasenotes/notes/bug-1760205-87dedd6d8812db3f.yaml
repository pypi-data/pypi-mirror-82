    [`bug 1760205 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1760205>`_]
    When deleting a shadow user, the related cache info is not invalidated so
    that Keystone will raise 404 UserNotFound error when authenticating with
    the previous federation info. This bug has been fixed now.

    A new interface called `list_federated_users_info` is added to shadow
    backend. It's used to get the shadow user information internally. If you
    are maintaining any out-tree shadow backends, please implement this
    function for them as well.
