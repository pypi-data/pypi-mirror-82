    [`blueprint bootstrap <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/bootstrap>`_]
    keystone-manage now supports the bootstrap command
    on the CLI so that a keystone install can be
    initialized without the need of the admin_token
    filter in the paste-ini.
security:
  - The use of admin_token filter is insecure compared
    to the use of a proper username/password. Historically
    the admin_token filter has been left enabled in
    Keystone after initialization due to the way CMS
    systems work. Moving to an out-of-band initialization using
    ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` will eliminate the security concerns around
    a static shared string that conveys admin access to keystone
    and therefore to the entire installation.
