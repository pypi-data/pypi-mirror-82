    [`bug 1780503 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1780503>`_]
    The notification wrapper now sets the initiator's id to the given user
    id. This fixes an issue where identity.authentication event would result
    in the initiator id being a random default UUID, rather than the user's id
    when said user would authenticate against keystone.
