    [`bug 1872753 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872753>`_]
    Added validation to the EC2 credential API to prevent altering the ``access_id``
    field in the blob attribute. This prevents accidentally orphaning an EC2 credential
    resource when an altered ``access_id`` no longer resolves to the credential's
    resource ID.
