    [`blueprint whitelist-extension-for-app-creds <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/whitelist-extension-for-app-creds>`_]
    This release adds support for delegating fine-grained privileges to
    application credentials via access rules. Access rules act as a whitelist
    of APIs that an application credential is allowed to use. Regular RBAC is
    still enforced by oslo.policy. See the `API reference
    <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/#application-credentials>`_
    for details.
