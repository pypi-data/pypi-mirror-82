    [`bug 1805880 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805880>`_]
    The registered limit policies in ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` policy
    file have been removed in favor of better defaults in code. These
    policies weren't tested exhaustively and were misleading to users
    and operators.
