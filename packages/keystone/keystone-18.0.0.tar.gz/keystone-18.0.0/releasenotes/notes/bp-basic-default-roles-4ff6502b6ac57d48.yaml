      [`blueprint basic-default-roles  <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/basic-default-roles>`_]
      Support has been added for deploying two new roles during the bootstrap
      process, `reader` and `member`, in addition to the `admin` role.

  - |
      If the bootstrap process is re-run, and a `reader`, `member`, or `admin`
      role already exists, a role implication chain will be created: `admin`
      implies `member` implies `reader`. If you do not want these role
      implications either skip running bootstrap or delete them after it has
      completed execution. See
      [`blueprint basic-default-roles  <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/basic-default-roles>`_]
      for more details.
