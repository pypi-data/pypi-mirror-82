   [`blueprint pci-dss-notifications <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/pci-dss-notifications>`_]
   CADF notifications now extend to PCI-DSS events. A ``reason`` object
   is added to the notification. A ``reason`` object has both a ``reasonType``
   (a short description of the reason) and ``reasonCode`` (the HTTP return code).
   The following events will be impacted:

     * If a user does not change their passwords at least once every X days.
       See ``[security_compliance] password_expires_days``.
     * If a user is locked out after many failed authentication attempts.
       See ``[security_compliance] lockout_failure_attempts``.
     * If a user submits a new password that was recently used. See
       ``[security_compliance] unique_last_password_count``.
     * If a password does not meet the specified criteria. See
       ``[security_compliance] password_regex``.
     * If a user attempts to change their password too often. See
       ``[security_compliance] minimum_password_age``.
