    [`blueprint domain-specific-roles <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/domain-specific-roles>`_]
    Roles can now be optionally defined as domain specific. Domain specific
    roles are not referenced in policy files, rather they can be used to allow
    a domain to build their own private inference rules with implied roles. A
    domain specific role can be assigned to a domain or project within its
    domain, and any subset of global roles it implies will appear in a token
    scoped to the respective domain or project. The domain specific role
    itself, however, will not appear in the token.
