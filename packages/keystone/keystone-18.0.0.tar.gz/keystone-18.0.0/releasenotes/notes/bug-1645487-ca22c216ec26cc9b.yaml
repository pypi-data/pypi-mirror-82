    [`Bug 1645487 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1645487>`_]
    Added a new PCI-DSS feature that will require users to immediately change
    their password upon first use for new users and after an administrative
    password reset. The new feature can be enabled by setting
    [security_compliance] ``change_password_upon_first_use`` to ``True``.
