    `[`blueprint policy-in-code <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/policy-in-code>`_]
    Keystone now supports the ability to register default policies in code.
    This makes policy file maintenance easier by allowing duplicated default
    policies to be removed from the policy file. The only policies that should
    exist within a deployment's policy file after Pike should be policy
    overrides. Note that there is no longer a default value for the default
    rule. That rule is only checked when the more specific rule cannot be
    found, and with policy in code all rules should be found in code even if
    they are not in the policy file. To generate sample policy files from
    default values, prune default policies from existing policy files, or
    familiarize yourself with general policy usage, please see the
    `usage documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.policy/usage.html>`_
    provided in oslo.policy.
