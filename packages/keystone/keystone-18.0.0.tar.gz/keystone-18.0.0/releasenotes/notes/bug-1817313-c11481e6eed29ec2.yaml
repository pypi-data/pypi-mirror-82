    [`bug 1817313 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1817313>`_]
    Raise METHOD NOT ALLOWED for OS-Federation protocols creation
    if the protocol_id is not in the URL. The corrective action was to split
    the LIST from CRUD resources so that the routing regexes can work as
    expected.
