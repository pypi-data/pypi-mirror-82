    Replaced the usage of SQLAlchemy Inspector.from_engine() with the
    sqlalchemy.inspect() call, within several Alembic migration files as well
    as a test suite.   SQLAlchemy will be deprecating the former syntax,
    so this change allows forwads compatibility with the next series of
    SQLAlchemy.
