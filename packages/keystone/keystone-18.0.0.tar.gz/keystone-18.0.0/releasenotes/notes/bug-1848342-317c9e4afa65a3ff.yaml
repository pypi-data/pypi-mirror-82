    [`bug 1848342 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1848342>`_]
    There was an inconsistency in the ephemeral user update flow. Every time a
    federated user logged in, keystone created an entry in the local_user
    table instead of just updating the entries in the user and federated_user
    tables, which caused duplicate entries when listing users. Now, the
    keystone will not create the entry in the local_user table while updating
    an ephemeral user.

    If you are affected by this bug, a fix in the keystone database will be
    needed so we recommend to dump the users' tables before doing this process:

    mysql db example:
        - mysqldump -h <mysql host> -p -P <mysql port> -u keystone keystone federated_user local_user user > user_tables.sql
        - mysql -h <mysql host> -D keystone -p -P <mysql port> -u keystone -e 'delete from local_user where user_id in (select user_id from federated_user);'

    SQL:
     - delete from local_user where user_id in (select user_id from federated_user);
