    [`bug 1367113 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1367113>`_]
    The "get entity" and "list entities" functionality for the KVS catalog
    backend has been reimplemented to use the data from the catalog template.
    Previously this would only act on temporary data that was created at
    runtime. The create, update and delete entity functionality now raises
    an exception.
