    The federated identity provider policies defined in
    ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` have been removed. These policies
    are now obsolete after incorporating system-scope into the

    [`bug 1804517 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804517>`_]
    The federated identity provider policies in
    ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` policy file have been removed in
    favor of better defaults in code. These policies weren't tested
    exhaustively and were misleading to users and operators.
