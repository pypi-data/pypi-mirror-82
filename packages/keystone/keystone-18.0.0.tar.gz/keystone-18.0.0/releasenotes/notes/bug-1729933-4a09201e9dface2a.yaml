    [`bug 1729933 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1729933>`_]
    The Region Update API now correctly updates extra values. Previously
    adding any extra values to a region via the update API would discard
    any added values besides the default ones. Any extra values are now
    correctly added and returned. This fix was for consistency with other
    APIs in keystone that use 'extra' and the use of 'extra' in
    keystone is highly discouraged.
