    [`bug 1724645 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1724645>`_]
    Adds a new attribute, ``remote_id_attribute``, to the federation protocol
    object, which allows WebSSO authentication to forward authentication
    requests through the right implementation for a federated protocol based on
    the remote ID attribute in the authentication headers.

    [`bug 1724645 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1724645>`_]
    Fixes an issue where multiple implementations of a federation protocol,
    such as Shibboleth and Mellon for the SAML2.0 protocol, could not be
    differentiated from one another because they had to share the same globally
    configured remote ID attribute. Now the remote ID attribute can be set on
    the protocol object itself.
