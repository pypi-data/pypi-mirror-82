    [`bug 1809116 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1809116>`_]
    It is now possible to have group memberships carried over through mapping
    persist for a limited time after a user authenticates using federation.
    The "time to live" of these memberships is specified via the configuration
    option `[federation] default_authorization_ttl` or for each identity
    provider by setting `authorization_ttl` on the identity provider. Every
    time a user authenticates carrying over that membership, it will be
    renewed.

    If expiring user group memberships are enabled via the `[federation]
    default_authorization_ttl` configuration option, or on an idp by idp
    basis by setting `authorization_ttl`, there will be a lag between when
    a user is removed from a group in an identity provider, and when that
    will be reflected in keystone. That amount of time will be equal to
    the last time the user logged in + idp ttl.
