upgrade:
  - |
    [`bug 1805400 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805400>`_]
    The domain role API uses new default policies that make it more
    accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides role
    policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1805400 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805400>`_]
    The domain role policies have been deprecated. The
    ``identity:get_domain_role`` and ``identity:list_domain_roles`` policies
    now use ``role:reader and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``.  The ``identity:create_domain_role``,
    ``identity:update_domain_role``, and ``identity:delete_role`` policies now
    use ``role:admin and system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``.
    These new defaults automatically account for system-scope and support a
    read-only role, making it easier for system administrators to delegate
    subsets of responsibility without compromising security. Please consider
    these new defaults if your deployment overrides the domain role policies.
