    [`bug 1630434 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1630434>`_]
    The entire ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` file has been removed. If you
    were using this policy file to supply overrides in your deployment, you
    should consider using the defaults in code and setting ``keystone.conf
    [oslo_policy] enforce_scope=True``. The new policy defaults are more
    flexible, they're tested extensively, and they solve all the problems the
    ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` file was trying to solve.
