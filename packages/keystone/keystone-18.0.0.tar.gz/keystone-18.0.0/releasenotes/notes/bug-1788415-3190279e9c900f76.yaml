    order to make the credentials API more accessible for all users and not
    just operators or system administrator. Please consider these updates when
    using this version of keystone since it could affect API behavior in your

    Improved self-service support has been implemented in the credential API.
    This means that end users have the ability to manage their own credentials
    as opposed to filing tickets to have deployment administrators manage
    credentials for users.
