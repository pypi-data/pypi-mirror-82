    [`bug 1718747 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1718747>`_]
    Fixes a regression where deleting a domain with users in it caues a server
    error. This bugfix restores the previous behavior of deleting the users
    namespaced in the domain. This only applies when using the SQL identity
    backend.

    [`bug 1718747 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1718747>`_]
    As part of solving a regression in the identity SQL backend that prevented
    domains containing users from being deleted, a notification callback was
    altered so that users would only be deleted if the identity backend is SQL.
    If you have a custom identity backend that is not read-only, deleting a
    domain in keystone will not delete the users in your backend unless your
    driver has an is_sql property that evaluates to true.
