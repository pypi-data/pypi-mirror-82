    [`bug 1696574 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1696574>`_]
    All GET APIs within keystone now have support for HEAD, if not already
    implemented. All new HEAD APIs have the same response codes and headers as
    their GET counterparts. This aids in client-side processing, especially
    caching.
