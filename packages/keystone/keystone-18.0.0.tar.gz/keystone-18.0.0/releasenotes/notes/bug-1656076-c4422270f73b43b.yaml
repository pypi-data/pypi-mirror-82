    [`bug 1650676 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1656076>`_]
    Authentication plugins now required ``AuthContext`` objects to be used. This
    has added security features to ensure information such as the ``user_id``
    does not change between authentication methods being processed
    by the server. The ``keystone.controllers.Auth.authenticate``
    method now requires the argument ``auth_context`` to be an actual
    ``AuthContext`` object.
