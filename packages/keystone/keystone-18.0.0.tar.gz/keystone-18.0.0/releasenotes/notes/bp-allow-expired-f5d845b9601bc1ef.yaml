    [`blueprint allow-expired <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/allow-expired>`_]
    An `allow_expired` flag is added to the token validation call
    (``GET/HEAD  /v3/auth/tokens``) that allows fetching a token that has
    expired. This allows for validating tokens in long running operations.

    [`blueprint allow-expired <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/allow-expired>`_]
    To allow long running operations to complete services must be able to fetch
    expired tokens via the ``allow_expired`` flag. The length of time a token is
    retrievable for beyond its traditional expiry is managed by the
    ``[token] allow_expired_window`` option and so the data must be retrievable
    for this amount of time. When using fernet tokens this means the key
    rotation period must exceed this time so older tokens are still
    decryptable. Ensure you do not rotate fernet keys faster than
    ``[token] expiration`` + ``[token] allow_expired_window`` seconds.
