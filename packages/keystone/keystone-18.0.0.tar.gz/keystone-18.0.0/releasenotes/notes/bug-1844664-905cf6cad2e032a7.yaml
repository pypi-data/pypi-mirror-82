deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1844664 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1844664>`_]
    The Project Endpoints policies have been deprecated. The
    ``identity:list_projects_for_endpoint`` now use  ``(role:reader and system_scope:all)``
    ``identity:check_endpoint_in_project`` policies now use
    ``role:reader and system_scope:all`` and ``identity:list_endpoints_for_project``
    now use  ``(role:reader and system_scope:all)`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. The ``identity:add_endpoint_to_project`` now use
    ``(role:admin and system_scope:all)``
    instead of ``rule:admin_required``and ``identity:remove_endpoint_from_project``
    policies now use ``role:admin and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``.
    These new defaults automatically account for system-scope and support
    a read-only role, making it easier for system administrators to delegate
    subsets of responsibility without compromising security. Please consider
    these new defaults if your deployment overrides the Project Endpoints policies.
