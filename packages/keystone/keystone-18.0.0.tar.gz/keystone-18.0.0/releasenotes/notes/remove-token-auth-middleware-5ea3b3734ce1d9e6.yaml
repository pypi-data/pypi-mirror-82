prelude: >
  The token_auth middleware functionality has been merged into the main auth
  middleware (keystone.middleware.auth.AuthContextMiddleware).
  `admin_token_auth` must be removed from the [pipeline:api_v3],
  [pipeline:admin_api], and [pipeline:public_api] sections of your paste ini
  file. The [filter:token_auth] block will also need to be removed from your
  paste ini file. Failure to remove these elements from your paste ini file
  will result in keystone to no longer start/run when the `token_auth` is
  removed in the Stein release.
upgrade:
  - Remove token_auth from your keystone paste.ini file. Failure to remove
    these elements from your paste ini file will result in keystone to no
    longer start/run when the `token_auth` is removed in the Stein release.
deprecations:
  - The keystone.middleware.core:TokenAuthMiddleware is deprecated for removal.
