    [`bug 1704205 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1704205>`_]
    All users and groups are required to have a name. Prior to this fix,
    Keystone was not properly enforcing this for LDAP users and groups.
    Keystone will now ignore users and groups that do not have a value for
    the LDAP attribute which Keystone has been configured to use for that
    entity's name.
