upgrade:
  - >
    The default setting for the `os_inherit` configuration option is
    changed to True. If it is required to continue with this portion
    of the API disabled, then override the default setting by explicitly
    specifying the os_inherit option as False.
deprecations:
  - The `os_inherit` configuration option is disabled. In the future, this
    option will be removed and this portion of the API will be always enabled.
