    [`bug 1805402 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805402>`_]

    ``reader`` default roles.
upgrade:
  - |
    [`bug 1805402 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805402>`_]
    The role API uses new default policies that make it more
    accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides role
    policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1805402 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805402>`_]
    The role policies have been deprecated. The ``identity:get_role`` and
    ``identity:list_roles`` policies now use ``role:reader and
    system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``. The
    ``identity:create_role``, ``identity:update_role``, and
    ``identity:delete_role`` policies now use ``role:admin and
    system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``. These new
    defaults automatically account for system-scope and support a read-only
    role, making it easier for system administrators to delegate subsets of
    responsibility without compromising security. Please consider these new
    defaults if your deployment overrides the role policies.
