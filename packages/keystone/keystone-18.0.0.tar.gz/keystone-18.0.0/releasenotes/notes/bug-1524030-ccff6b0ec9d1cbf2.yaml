    During token validation we have reduced the number of revocation events
    returned, only returning a subset of events relevant to the token. Thus,
    improving overall token validation performance.

    [`bug 1524030 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1524030>`_]
    The signature on the ``list_events`` method of ``keystone.revoke.backends.base.RevokeDriverBase``
    has been updated.

    Third-party extensions that extend the abstract class (``RevokeDriverBase``)
    should update their code according to the new parameter names.

    The method signature has changed from::

      list_events(self, last_fetch=None)

    to::

      list_events(self, last_fetch=None, token=None)
