    [`bug 1642687 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1642687>`_]
    The signature on the ``create_federated_user`` method of
    ``keystone.identity.shadow_backends.base.ShadowUsersDriverBase`` has been
    updated.

    Third-party extensions that extend the abstract class (``ShadowUsersDriverBase``)
    should be updated according to the new parameter names.

    The method signature has changed from::

      create_federated_user(self, federated_dict)

    to::

      create_federated_user(self, domain_id, federated_dict)

    Users that authenticate with an ``identity provider`` will now have a
    ``domain_id`` attribute, that is associated with the ``identity provider``.
