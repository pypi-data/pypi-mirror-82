    [`bug 1833739 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1833739>`_]
    Fix PostgreSQL specifc issue with storing encrypted credentials. In
    Python 3 the psycopg2 module treats bytes strings as binary data. This
    causes issues when storing encrypted credentials in the Database.
    To fix this isseu the credentials sql backend is updated to encode the
    credential into a text string before handing it over to the database.
