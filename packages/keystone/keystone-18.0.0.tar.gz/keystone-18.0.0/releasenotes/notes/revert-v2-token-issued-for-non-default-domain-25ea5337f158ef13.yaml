    Reverted the change that eliminates the ability to get
    a V2 token with a user or project that is not in the
    default domain. This change broke real-world deployments
    that utilized the ability to authenticate via V2 API
    with a user not in the default domain or with a
    project not in the default domain. The deployer
    is being convinced to update code to properly handle
    V3 auth but the fix broke expected and tested
    behavior.
