    [`bug 1535878 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1535878>`_]
    Originally, to perform GET /projects/{project_id}, the provided policy
    files required a user to have at least project admin level of permission.
    They have been updated to allow it to be performed by any user who has a
    role on the project.
