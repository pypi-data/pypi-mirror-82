    [`bug 1818845 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1818845>`_]
    The ``identity:revocation_list`` policy has been deprecated for removal.
    This policy didn't actually protect the revocation list API since that API
    is unenforced and unprotected. It only returns an ``HTTP 410`` or ``HTTP
    403`` depending on how keystone is configured. This policy can be safely
    removed.
