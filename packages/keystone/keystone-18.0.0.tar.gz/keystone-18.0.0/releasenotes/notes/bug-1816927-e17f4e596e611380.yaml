    [`bug 1816927 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1816927>`_]
    It was discovered that the order in which fernet keys are distributed
    after fernet key rotation has impact on keystone service.
    All operators are advised to ensure that during fernet key distribution
    the new primary fernet key (with largest number) is distributed first.
