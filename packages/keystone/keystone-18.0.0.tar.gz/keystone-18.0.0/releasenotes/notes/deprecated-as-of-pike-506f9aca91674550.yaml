deprecations:
  - |
    * UUID token provider ``[token] provider=uuid`` has been deprecated in
      favor of Fernet tokens ``[token] provider=fernet``. With Fernet tokens
      becoming the default UUID tokens can be slated for removal in the R
      release. This also deprecates token-bind support as it was never
      implemented for fernet.

    * Token persistence driver/code (SQL) is deprecated with this patch since
      it is only used by the UUID token provider..
