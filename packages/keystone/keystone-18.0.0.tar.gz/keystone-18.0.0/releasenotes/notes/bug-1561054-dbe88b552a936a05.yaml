    The default token provider has switched from UUID to Fernet. Please note
    Fernet requires a key repository to be in place prior to running Ocata,
    this can be done by running ``keystone-manage fernet_setup``.
    Additionally, for multi-node deployments, it is imperative a key
    distribution process be in use before upgrading. Once a key repository has
    been created it should be distributed to all keystone nodes in the deployment.
    This ensures each keystone node will be able to validate tokens issued
    across the deployment. If you do not wish to switch token formats, you will
    need to explicitly set the token provider for each node in the deployment
    by setting ``[token] provider`` to ``uuid`` in ``keystone.conf``.
    Documentation can be found at `fernet-tokens <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/configuration.html#encryption-keys-for-fernet-tokens>`_.

    If upgrading to Fernet tokens, you must have a key repository and key distribution
    mechanism in place, otherwise token validation may not work. Please see the
    upgrade section for more details.
