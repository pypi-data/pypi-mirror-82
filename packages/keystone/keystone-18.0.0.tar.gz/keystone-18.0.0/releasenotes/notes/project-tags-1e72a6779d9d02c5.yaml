    [`blueprint project-tags <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/project-tags>`_]
    Projects have a new property called tags. These tags
    are simple strings that can be used to allow projects
    to be filtered/searched. Project tags will have the
    following properties:

        * Tags are case sensitive
        * '/' and ',' are not allowed to be in a tag
        * Each project can have up to 100 tags
        * Each tag can be up to 255 characters

    See `Project Tags <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/#project-tags>`_

    Project tags are implemented following the guidelines
    set by the `API Working Group <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/tags.html>`_
