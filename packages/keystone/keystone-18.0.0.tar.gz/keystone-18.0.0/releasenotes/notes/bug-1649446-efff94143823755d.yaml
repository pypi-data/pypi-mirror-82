    [`Bug 1649446 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1651989>`_]
    The default policy for listing revocation events has changed. Previously,
    any authenticated user could list revocation events; it is now, by default,
    an admin or service user only function. This can be changed by modifying
    the policy file being used by keystone.
