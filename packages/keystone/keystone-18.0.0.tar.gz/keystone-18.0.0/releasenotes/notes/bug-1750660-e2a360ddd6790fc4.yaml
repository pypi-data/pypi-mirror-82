upgrade:

    [`bug 1750660 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1750660>`_]
    The project API uses new default policies that make it more
    accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides
    project policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1750660 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1750660>`_]
    The project policies have been deprecated. The ``identity:get_project`` policy
    now uses ``(role:reader and system_scope:all) or (role:reader and
    domain_id:%(target.project.domain_id)s) or project_id:%(target.project.id)s``
    instead of ``rule:admin_required or project_id:%(target.project.id)s``.
    The ``identity:list_projects`` policy now uses ``(role:reader and
    system_scope:all) or (role:reader and domain_id:%(target.domain_id)s``
    instead of ``rule:admin_required``. The ``identity:list_user_projects``
    policy now uses ``(role:reader and system_scope:all) or (role:reader and
    domain_id:%(target.user.domain_id)s) or user_id:%(target.user.id)s``
    instead of ``rule:admin_or_owner``. The ``identity:create_project``
    now uses ``(role:admin and system_scope:all) or (role:admin and
    domain_id:%(target.project.domain_id)s)`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. These new defaults automatically include
    support for a read-only role and allow for more granular access
    to project APIs, making it easier for system and domain administrators
    to delegate authorization, safely. Please consider these new defaults
    if your deployment overrides the project policies.

    The project API now uses system-scope, domain-scope, project-scope and default
    roles to provide better accessibility to users in a secure way.
