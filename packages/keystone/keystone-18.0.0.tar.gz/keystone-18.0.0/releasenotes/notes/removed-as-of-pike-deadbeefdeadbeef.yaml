    All key-value-store code, options, and documentation has been removed as of the Pike release.
    The removed code included ``keystone.common.kvs`` configuration options for the KVS code,
    unit tests, and the KVS token persistence driver ``keystone.token.persistence.backends.kvs``.
    All associated documentation has been removed.

    The ``admin_token_auth`` filter has been removed from all sample pipelines,
    specifically, the following section has been removed from ``keystone-paste.ini``::

      [filter:admin_token_auth]
      use = egg:keystone#admin_token_auth

    The functionality of the ``ADMIN_TOKEN`` remains, but has been incorporated
    into the main auth middleware (``keystone.middleware.auth.AuthContextMiddleware``).

    The catalog backend ``endpoint_filter.sql`` has been removed. It has been
    consolidated with the ``sql`` backend, therefore replace the
    ``endpoint_filter.sql`` catalog backend with the ``sql`` backend.
  - >
    The ``[security_compliance] password_expires_ignore_user_ids`` option has
    been removed. Each user that should ignore password expiry should have the
    value set to "true" in the user's ``options`` attribute (e.g.
    ``user['options']['ignore_password_expiry'] = True``) with a user update
    call.

    The ``keystone.common.ldap`` module was removed from the code tree. It was
    deprecated in the Newton release in favor of using
    ``keystone.identity.backends.ldap.common`` which has the same functionality.

    The ``keystone-manage pki_setup`` was added to aid developer setup by hiding the sometimes cryptic
    openssl commands. This is no longer needed since keystone no longer supports PKI tokens and can no
    longer serve SSL. This was deprecated in the Mitaka release.

    Direct import of drivers outside of their `keystone` namespace has been
    removed. Ex. identity drivers are loaded from the `keystone.identity`
    namespace and assignment drivers from the `keystone.assignment` namespace.
    Loading drivers outside of their keystone namespaces was deprecated in the
    Liberty release.
