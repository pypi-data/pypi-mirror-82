upgrade:
  - Keystone now supports encrypted credentials at rest.
    In order to upgrade successfully to Newton, deployers
    must encrypt all credentials currently stored before
    contracting the database. Deployers must run
    `keystone-manage credential_setup` in order to use the
    credential API within Newton, or finish the upgrade
    from Mitaka to Newton. This will result in a service
    outage for the credential API where credentials will
    be read-only for the duration of the upgrade process.
    Once the database is contracted credentials will be
    writeable again. Database contraction phases only
    apply to rolling upgrades.
