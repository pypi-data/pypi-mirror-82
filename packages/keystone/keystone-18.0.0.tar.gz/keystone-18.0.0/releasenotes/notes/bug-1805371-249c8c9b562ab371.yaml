    [`bug 1805371 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805371>`_]

    make it more accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way.

    [`bug 1805371 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805371>`_]
    The implied roles policies have been deprecated. The
    ``identity:get_implied_role``, ``identity:list_implied_roles``,
    ``identity:list_role_inference_rules``, and ``identity:check_implied_role``
    policies now use ``role:reader and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. The ``identity:create_implied_role`` and
    ``identity:delete_implied_role`` policies now use ``role:admin and
    system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``.
    These new defaults automatically account for system-scope and support
    a read-only role, making it easier for system administrators to delegate
    subsets of responsibility without compromising security. Please consider
    these new defaults if your deployment overrides the implied roles policies.
