    [`bug 1804516 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804516>`_]
    The federated identity provider API uses new default policies that
    make it more accessible to end users and administrators in a
    secure way. Please consider these new defaults if your deployment
    overrides federated identity provider policies.

    [`bug 1804516 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804516>`_]
    The federated identity provider policies have been deprecated.
    The ``identity:list_identity_providers`` and
    ``identity:get_identity_provider`` policies now use ``role:reader
    and system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``. The
    ``identity:create_identity_provider``, ``identity:update_identity_provider``,
    ``identity:delete_identity_provider`` policies now use ``role:admin and
    system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``.
    These new defaults automatically account for system-scope and support
    a read-only role, making it easier for system administrators to
    delegate subsets of responsibility without compromising security.
    Please consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides the
    federated identity provider policies.
