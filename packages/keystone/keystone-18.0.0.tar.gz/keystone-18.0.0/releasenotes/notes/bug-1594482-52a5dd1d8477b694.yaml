    [`bug 1594482 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1594482>`_]
    When using list_limit config option, the GET /services?name={service_name}
    API was first truncating the list and afterwards filtering by name.
    The API was fixed to first filter by name and only afterwards truncate the
    result list to the desired limit.
