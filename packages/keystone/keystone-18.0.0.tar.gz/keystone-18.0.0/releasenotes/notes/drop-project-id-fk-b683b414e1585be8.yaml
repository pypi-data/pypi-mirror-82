    The foreign key constraint between the ``user.domain_id`` column and the
    ``project.id`` column and between the ``identity_provider.domain_id``
    column and the ``project.id`` column will be dropped upon running the
    keystone db_sync contraction step. These constraints are enforced in code
    and do not need to be enforced by the database. This should have no impact
    on users.
