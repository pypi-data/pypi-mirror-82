    The default policies that protect the domains API have been deprecated in
    favor of ones that are more secure and self-serviceable. If you're
    maintaining custom policies, please make sure you resolve your domain
    policies to work with the new default by adding the proper role
    assignments, or continue maintaining custom overrides. The new defaults
    allow for better protection of the domains API when giving the `admin` role
    to users on domains and projects.

    The default policies that protect the domains API have been deprecated in
    favor of ones that are more secure and self-serviceable. Users with roles
    on domains and projects are now able to call the
    ``GET /v3/domains/{domain_id}`` API if they use a token scoped to that
    domain or a token scoped to a project within that domain. System users are
    allowed to access the domain APIs in the same way legacy `admin` users were
    able to. This allows for better protection of the domain API when giving
    the `admin` role to users on domains and projects.
