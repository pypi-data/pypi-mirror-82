    [`bug 1823258 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1823258>`_]
    The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command now defaults to making the
    default roles (`admin`, `member`, and `reader`) immutable. This has the
    consequence that if the bootstrap command is re-run on an existing
    deployment, those roles will become immutable if they were not before. To
    opt out of this behavior, add the ``--no-immutable-roles`` flag to the
    bootstrap command.
