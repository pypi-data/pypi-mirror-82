    [`bug 1649138 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1649138>`_]
    When using LDAP as an identity backend, the initial bind will now
    occur upon creation of a connection object, i.e. early on when
    performing LDAP queries, no matter whether the bind is
    authenticated or anonymous, so that any connection errors can be
    handled correctly and early.
