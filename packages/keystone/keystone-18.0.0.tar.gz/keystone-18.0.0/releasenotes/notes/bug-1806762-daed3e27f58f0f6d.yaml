    The protocol policies defined in the ``policy.v3cloudsample.json``
    policy file have been removed. These policies are now obsolete after

    [`bug 1804518 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804518>`_]
    The federated protocol policies in the ``policy.v3cloudsample.json``
    policy file have been removed in favor of better defaults in code.
    These policies weren't tested exhaustively and were misleading to
    users and operators.
