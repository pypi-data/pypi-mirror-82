    Some bugs for unified limit APIs have been fixed, it includes:

      * [`bug 1798716 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1798716>`_]
        The `region_id` of registered limit now can be updated to `None`.
      * [`bug 1798495 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1798495>`_]
        The length of unified limit's `resource_name` now is limited from `1`
        to `255` (string).
      * [`bug 1797876 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1797876>`_]
        The `default_limit` of registered limit and the `resource_limit` of
        limit now are limited from `-1` to `2147483647` (integer). `-1` means
        no limit. `2147483647` is the max value for integer by default in SQL
        (4 bytes).
