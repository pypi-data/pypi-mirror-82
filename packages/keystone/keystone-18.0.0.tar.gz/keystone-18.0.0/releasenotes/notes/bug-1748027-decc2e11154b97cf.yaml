    [`bug 1748027 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1748027>`_]
    The user API now supports the ``admin``, ``member``, and
    ``reader`` default roles across system-scope, domain-scope, and
    project-scope.
upgrade:
  - |
    [`bug 1748027 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1748027>`_]
    The user API uses new default policies that make it more
    accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides
    user policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1748027 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1748027>`_]
    The user policies have been deprecated. The ``identity:get_user``
    policy now uses ``(role:reader and system_scope:all) or
    (role:reader and token.domain.id:%(target.user.domain_id)s) or
    user_id:%(target.user.id)s`` instead of ``rule:admin_or_owner``.
    The ``identity:list_users`` policy now uses ``(role:reader and
    system_scope:all) or (role:reader and
    domain_id:%(target.domain_id)s)`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``.  The ``identity:create_user``,
    ``identity:update_user``, and ``identity:delete_user`` policies
    now use ``(role:admin and system_scope:all) or (role:admin and
    token.domain.id:%(target.user.domain_id)s)`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. These new defaults automatically include
    support for a read-only role and allow for more granular access to
    user APIs, making it easier for system and domain administrators
    to delegate authorization, safely.  Please consider these new
    defaults if your deployment overrides user policies.

    roles to provide better accessibility to users in a secure way.
