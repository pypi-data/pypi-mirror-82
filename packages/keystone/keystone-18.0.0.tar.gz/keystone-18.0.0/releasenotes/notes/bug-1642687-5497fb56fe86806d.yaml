    When registering an ``identity provider`` via the OS-FEDERATION API, it is
    now recommended to include a ``domain_id`` to associate with the
    ``identity provider`` in the request. Federated users that authenticate with
    the ``identity provider`` will now be associated with the ``domain_id``
    specified. If no ``domain_id`` is specified, then a domain will be automatically
    created.

    Upon a successful upgrade, all existing ``identity providers`` will now
    be associated with an automatically created domain. Each ``identity provider``
    that existed prior to the `Ocata` release will now have a ``domain_id`` field.
    The new domain will have an ``id`` (random UUID), a ``name`` (that will match
    the ``identity provider`` ID , and be ``enabled`` by default.
