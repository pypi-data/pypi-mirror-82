    Added support for a `user_description_attribute` mapping
    to the LDAP driver configuration.
upgrade:
  - >
    The LDAP driver now also maps the user description attribute after
    user retrieval from LDAP.
    If this is undesired behavior for your setup, please add `description`
    to the `user_attribute_ignore` LDAP driver config setting.

    The default mapping of the description attribute is set to `description`.
    Please adjust the LDAP driver config setting `user_description_attribute`
    if your LDAP uses a different attribute name (for instance to `displayName`
    in case of an AD backed LDAP).

    If your `user_additional_attribute_mapping` setting contains
    `description:description` you can remove this mapping, since this is
    now the default behavior.
