    The configuration options for LDAP connection pooling, `[ldap] use_pool`
    and `[ldap] use_auth_pool`, are now both enabled by default. Only
    deployments using LDAP drivers are affected. Additional configuration
    options are available in the `[ldap]` section to tune connection pool size,
    etc.
