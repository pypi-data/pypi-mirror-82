    [`blueprint unified-limit <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/unified-limit>`_]
    Keystone now supports unified limits. Two resouces called ``registered
    limit`` and ``limit`` are added and a batch of related APIs are supported
    as well. These APIs are experimental now. It means that they are not stable
    enough and may be changed without backward compatibility. Once unified
    limit feature are ready for consuming, the APIs will be marked as stable.
