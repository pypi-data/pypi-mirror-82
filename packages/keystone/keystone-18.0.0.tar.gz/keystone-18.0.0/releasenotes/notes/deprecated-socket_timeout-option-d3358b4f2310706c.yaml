    The socket timeout configuration option for memcache of Keystone's
    definition isn't actually used anywhere [0], it would appear to be
    a broken knob. In fact oslo.cache has a duplicate option that appears
    to be used instead [1].
    We can deprecate the keystone-specific option and point people to the
    oslo.cache option.
