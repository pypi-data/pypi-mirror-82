    [`bug 1703666 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1703666>`_]
    Fixing multi-region support for the templated v3 catalog by making sure
    that the catalog contains only one definition per endpoint, and that
    each region is listed under that endpoint. Previously each region
    and endpoint would have had its own definition.
