    [`blueprint mfa-auth-receipt <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/mfa-auth-receipt>`_]
    Added support for auth receipts. Allows multi-step authentication for users
    with configured MFA Rules. Partial authentication with successful auth
    methods will return an auth receipt that can be consumed in subsequent auth
    attempts along with the missing auth methods to complete auth and be
    provided with a valid token.

    [`blueprint mfa-auth-receipt <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/mfa-auth-receipt>`_]
    Auth receipts share the same fernet mechanism as tokens and by default
    will share keys with tokens and work out of the box. If your fernet key
    directory is not the default, you will need to also configure the receipt
    key directory, but they can both point to the same location allowing key
    rotations to affect both safely. It is possible to split receipt and token
    keys and run rotatations separately for both if needed.
