    The user policies defined in ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` have
    been removed. These policies are now obsolete after incorporating
    system-scope, domain-scope, and project-scope into the user API
    and implementing default roles.

    [`bug 1806762 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1806762>`_]
    The user policies in ``policy.v3cloudsample.json`` policy file
    have been removed in favor of better defaults in code. These
    policies weren't tested exhaustively and were misleading to users
    and operators.
