    [`bug 1773967 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1773967>`_]
    Fixes an issue where users who had role assignments only via a group
    membership and not via direct assignment could create but not use
    application credentials. It is important to note that federated users who
    only have role assignments via a mapped group membership still cannot
    create application credentials.
