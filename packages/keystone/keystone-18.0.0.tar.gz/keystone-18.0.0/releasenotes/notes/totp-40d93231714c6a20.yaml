   [`blueprint totp-auth <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/totp-auth>`_]
   Keystone now supports authenticating via Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).
   To enable this feature, add the ``totp`` auth plugin to the `methods`
   option in the `[auth]` section of `keystone.conf`. More information
   about using TOTP can be found in `keystone's developer documentation
   <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/auth-totp.html>`_.
