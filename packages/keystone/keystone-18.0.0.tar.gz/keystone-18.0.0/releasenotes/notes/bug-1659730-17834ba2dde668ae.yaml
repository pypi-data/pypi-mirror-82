    [`bug 1659730 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1659730>`_]
    The signature on the ``authenticate`` method of ``keystone.auth.plugins.base.AuthMethodHandler``
    has been updated.

    Third-party extensions that extend the abstract class
    (``AuthMethodHandler``) should update their code according to the new
    parameter names.

    The method signature has changed from::

      authenticate(self, context, auth_payload, auth_context)

    to::

      authenticate(self, request, auth_payload, auth_context)
