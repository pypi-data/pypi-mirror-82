    [`blueprint pci-dss-password-requirements-api <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/pci-dss-password-requirements-api>`_]
    Added a new API (``/v3/domains/{domain_id}/config/security_compliance``) to
    retrieve regular expression requirements for passwords. Specifically,
    ``[security_compliance] password_regex`` and ``[security_compliance] password_regex_description``
    will be returned. Note that these options are only meaningful if PCI support
    is enabled, via various ``[security_compliance]`` configuration options.
