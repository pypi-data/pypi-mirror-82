  - |
    The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command will now update existing
    endpoints rather than skipping them if they already exist but are different
    from the values provided to the command. This is useful in conjunction with
    configuration management tools that use this command for both
    initialization and lifecycle management of keystone.
