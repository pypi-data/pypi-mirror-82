    [`bug 1782922 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1782922>`_]
    Fixed the problem where Keystone indiscriminately return the first RDN
    as the user ID, regardless whether it matches the configured
    'user_id_attribute' or not. This will break deployments where
    'group_members_are_ids' are set to False and 'user_id_attribute' is not
    in the DN. This patch will perform a lookup by DN if the first RND does
    not match the configured 'user_id_attribute'.
