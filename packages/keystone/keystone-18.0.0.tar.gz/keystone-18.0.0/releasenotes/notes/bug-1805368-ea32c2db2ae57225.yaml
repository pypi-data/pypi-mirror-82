    The grant APIs use new default policies that make it more accessible to
    domain users in a safe and secure way. Please consider these new defaults
    if your deployment overrides the grant APIs.

    The grant policies have been deprecated and replaced with new policies that
    expose grant APIs to domain users. This allows deployments to delegate more
    functionality to domain owners by default. The ``identity:check_grant`` and
    ``identity:list_grants`` policies now use ``(role:reader and
    system_scope:all) or (role:reader and domain_id:%(target.user.domain_id)s)
    or (role:reader and domain_id:%(target.group.domain_id)s)`` instead of
    ``role:reader and system_scope:all``.  The ``identity:create_grant`` and
    ``identity:revoke_grant`` policies now use ``(role:admin and
    system_scope:all) or (role:admin and domain_id:%(target.user.domain_id)s)
    or (role:admin and domain_id:%(target.group.domain_id)s)`` instead of
    ``role:admin and system_scope:all``.  These new defaults automatically
    include support for domain reader and domain administrator roles, making it
    easier for system administrator to delegate functionality down to domain
    users to manage grants within their domains. Please consider these new
    defaults if your deployment overrides the grant APIs.
