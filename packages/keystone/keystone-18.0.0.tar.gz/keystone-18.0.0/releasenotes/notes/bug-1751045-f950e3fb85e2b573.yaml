    [`bug 1751045 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1751045>`_]
    It is now possible to clean up role assignments for groups that don't exist
    in the identity backend. This is relevant to deployments that are backed by
    LDAP and groups are removed directly by LDAP and not through keystone.
