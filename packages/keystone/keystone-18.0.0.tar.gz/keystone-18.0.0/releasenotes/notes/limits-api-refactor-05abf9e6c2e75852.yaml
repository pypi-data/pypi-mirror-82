    [`bug 1754184 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1754184>`_]
    The unified limit APIs has been refactored to align with the following
    API-WG guidelines:
    1. POST unified limits no longer returns all the limits during create
    operations. It now only returns the newly created limits.
    2. Support for updating multiple limits in a single request has been
    removed by implementing PATCH instead of PUT.
    Please note that the unified limits APIs is still experimental making it
    possible to include these improvements.
