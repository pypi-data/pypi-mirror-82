upgrade:
  - In the policy.json file, we changed `identity:list_projects_for_groups`
    to `identity:list_projects_for_user`. Likewise, we changed
    `identity:list_domains_for_groups` to `identity:list_domains_for_user`. If
    you have customized the policy.json file, you will need to make these
    changes. This was done to better support new features around federation.
