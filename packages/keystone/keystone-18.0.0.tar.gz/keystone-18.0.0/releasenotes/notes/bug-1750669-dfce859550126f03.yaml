    The system assignment API now supports the ``admin``, ``member``,
    and ``reader`` default roles across system-scope, domain-scope, and
    project-scope. The grant API now supports the ``admin``,
    ``member``, and ``reader`` default roles for system-scope.

    The system assignment and grant APIs uses new default policies that
    make it more accessible to end users and administrators in a secure
    way. Please consider these new defaults if your deployment
    overrides system assignment policies.

    [`bug 1750669 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1750669>`_]
    The system assignment and grant policies have been deprecated. The
    ``identity:list_system_grants_for_user``,
    ``identity:check_system_grant_for_user``,
    ``identity:list_system_grants_for_group``, and
    ``identity:check_system_grant_for_group`` policies now use
    ``role:reader and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. The
    ``identity:create_system_grant_for_user``,
    ``identity:revoke_system_grant_for_user``,
    ``identity:create_system_grant_for_group``, and
    ``identity:revoke_system_grant_for_group`` policies now use
    ``role:admin and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. The ``identity:check_grant`` and
    ``identity:list_grants`` policies now use ``role:reader and
    system_scope:all`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``.  The
    ``identity:create_grant`` and ``identity:revoke_grant`` policies
    now use ``role:admin and system_scope:all`` instead of
    ``rule:admin_required``. These new defaults automatically include
    support for a read-only role and allow for more granular access to
    the system assignment and grant APIs, making it easier for
    administrators to delegate authorization, safely. Please consider
    these new defaults if your deployment overrides the system
    assignment APIs.

    The system assignment API now uses system-scope, domain-scope,
    project-scope, and default roles to provide better accessibility to
    users in a secure way. The grant API now uses system-scope and
    default to provide better accessbility to operators.
