    [`bug 1823258 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1823258>`_]
    Adds support for an "immutable" resource option for roles, which when
    enabled prevents accidental harmful modification or deletion of roles. Also
    adds a new flag ``--immutable-roles`` to the ``keystone-manage bootstrap``
    command to make the default roles (admin, member, and reader) immutable by
    default, as well as a check in the ``keystone-status upgrade check``
    command to check that these roles have been made immutable. In a future
    release, these three roles will be immutable by default.
