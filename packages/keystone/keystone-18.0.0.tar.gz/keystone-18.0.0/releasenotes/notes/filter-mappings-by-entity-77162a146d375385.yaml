    As a performance improvement, the base mapping driver's method
    ``get_domain_mapping_list`` now accepts an optional named argument
    ``entity_type`` that can be used to get the mappings for a given
    entity type only.
    As this new call signature is already used in the ``identity.core``
    module, authors/maintainers of out-of-tree custom mapping drivers
    are expected to update their implementations of ``get_domain_mapping_list``
    method accordingly.
