    [`bug 1636950 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1636950>`_]
    New option ``[ldap] connection_timeout`` allows a deployer to set a
    ``OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT`` value to use with the LDAP server.
    This allows the LDAP server to return a ``SERVER_DOWN`` exception,
    if the LDAP URL is incorrect or if there is a connection failure. By default,
    the value for ``[ldap] connection_timeout`` is -1, meaning it is disabled.
    Set a positive value (in seconds) to enable the option.
