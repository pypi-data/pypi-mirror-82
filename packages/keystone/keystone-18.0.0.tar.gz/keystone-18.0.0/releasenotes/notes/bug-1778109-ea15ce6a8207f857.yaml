    [`bug 1778109 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1778109>`_]
    Previously the token data for a trust-scoped token may have contained
    duplicate roles, when implied roles were present. This is no longer the
    case, for the sake of accuracy and to prevent the breaking of applications
    which may consume this role list.
