    [`bug 1804463 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804463>`_]

    ``reader`` default roles.
upgrade:
  - |
    [`bug 1804463 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804463>`_]
    The services API uses new default policies that make it more
    accessible to end users and administrators in a secure way. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides
    service policies.
deprecations:
  - |
    [`bug 1804463 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1804463>`_]
    The service policies have been deprecated. The ``identity:get_service`` and
    ``identity:list_services`` policies now use ``(role:reader and
    system_scope:all)`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``. The
    ``identity:create_service``, ``identity:update_service``, and
    ``identity:delete_service`` policies now use ``(role:admin and
    system_scope:all)`` instead of ``rule:admin_required``. These new defaults
    automatically account for system-scope and support a read-only role, making
    it easier for system administrators to delegate subsets of responsibility
    without compromising security. Please consider these new defaults if your
    deployment overrides service policies.
