    [`bug 1740951 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1740951>`_]
    A new method was added that made it so oslo.policy sample generation
    scripts can be used with keystone. The ``oslopolicy-policy-generator``
    script will now generate a policy file containing overrides and defaults
    registered in code.
