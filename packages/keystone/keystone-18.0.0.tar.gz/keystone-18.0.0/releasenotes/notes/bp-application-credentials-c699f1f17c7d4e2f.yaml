    This release adds support for Application Credentials, a new way to allow
    applications and automated tooling to authenticate with keystone. Rather
    than storing a username and password in an application's config file, which
    can pose security risks, you can now create an application credential to
    allow an application to authenticate and acquire a preset scope and role
    assignments. This is especially useful for LDAP and federated users, who
    can now delegate their cloud management tasks to a keystone-specific
    resource, rather than share their externally managed credentials with
    keystone and risk a compromise of those external systems. Users can
    delegate a subset of their role assignments to an application credential,
    allowing them to strategically limit their application's access to the
    minimum needed. Unlike passwords, a user can have more than one active
    application credential, which means they can be rotated without causing
    downtime for the applications using them.

    Users can now create Application Credentials, a new keystone resource that
    can provide an application with the means to get a token from keystone with
    a preset scope and role assignments. To authenticate with an application
    credential, an application can use the normal token API with the
    'application_credential' auth method.
