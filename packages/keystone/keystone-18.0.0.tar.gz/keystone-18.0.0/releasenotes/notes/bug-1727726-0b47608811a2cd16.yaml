    [`bug 1727726 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1727726>`_]
    All users and groups are required to have a name. Prior to this fix,
    Keystone was allowing LDAP users and groups whose name has only empty
    white spaces. Keystone will now ignore users and groups that do have
    only white spaces as value for the LDAP attribute which Keystone has
    been configured to use for that entity's name.
