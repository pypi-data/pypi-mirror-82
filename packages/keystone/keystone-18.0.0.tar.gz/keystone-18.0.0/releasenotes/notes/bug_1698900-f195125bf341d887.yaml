    [`bug 1698900 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1698900>`_]
    The implementation for checking database state during an upgrade with the
    use of `keystone-manage db_sync --check` has been corrected. This allows
    users and automation to determine what step is next in a rolling upgrade
    based on logging and command status codes.
