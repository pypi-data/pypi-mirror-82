    [`Bug 1856904 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1856904>`_]
    The initiator object for CADF notifications now will always contain the
    username for the user who initated the action. Previously, the initator
    object only contained the user_id, which lead to issues mapping to users
    when using LDAP-backed identity providers. This also helps the initiator
    object better conform to the OpenStack standard for CADF.
