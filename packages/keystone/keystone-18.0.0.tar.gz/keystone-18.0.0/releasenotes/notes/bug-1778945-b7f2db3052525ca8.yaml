    The pluggable interface for token providers has changed. If you're
    maintaining a custom token provider, you're going to be affected by these
    interface changes. Implementing the new interface will be required before
    using your custom token provider with the Rocky release of keystone. The
    new interface is more clear about the relationship and responsibilities
    between the token API and pluggable token providers.

    There were several improvements made to the token provider API and
    interface that simplify what external developers need to do and understand
    in order to provide their own token provider implementation. Please see the
    linked bug report for more details as to why these changes were made and
    the benefits they provide for both upstream and downstream developers.
