    [`bug 1515302 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1515302>`_]
    Two new configuration options have been added to the `[ldap]` section.
    `user_enabled_emulation_use_group_config` and
    `project_enabled_emulation_use_group_config`, which allow deployers to
    choose if they want to override the default group LDAP schema option.
