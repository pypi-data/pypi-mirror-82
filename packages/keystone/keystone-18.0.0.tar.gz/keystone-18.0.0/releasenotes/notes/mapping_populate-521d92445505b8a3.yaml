    Add ``keystone-manage mapping_populate`` command, which
    should be used when domain-specific LDAP backend is
    used.
features:
  - Add ``keystone-manage mapping_populate`` command.
    This command will pre-populate a mapping table with all
    users from LDAP, in order to improve future query
    performance. It should be used when an LDAP is first
    configured, or after calling ``keystone-manage mapping_purge``,
    before any queries related to the domain are made. For more
    information see ``keystone-manage mapping_populate --help``
