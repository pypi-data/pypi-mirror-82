    [`bug 1702211 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1702211>`_]
    Password `created_at` field under some versions/deployments of MySQL would
    lose sub-second precision. This means that it was possible for passwords to
    be returned out-of-order when changed within one second (especially common
    in testing). This change stores password `created_at` and `expires_at` as
    an integer instead of as a DATETIME data-type.
