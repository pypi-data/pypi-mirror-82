    [`bug 1728690 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1728690>`_]
    The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command will only create the admin role
    and will no longer create a default member role. Please create any
    additional roles you need after running ``bootstrap`` by using the
    ``openstack role create`` command.

    The config option ``rolling_upgrade_password_hash_compat`` is removed. It
    is only used for rolling-upgrade from Ocata release to Pike release.
