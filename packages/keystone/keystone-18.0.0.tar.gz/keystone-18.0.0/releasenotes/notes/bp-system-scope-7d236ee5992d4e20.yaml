    [`blueprint system-scope <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/system-scope>`_]
    Keystone now supports the ability to assign roles to users and groups on
    the system. As a result, users and groups with system role assignment will
    be able to request system-scoped tokens. Additional logic has been added to
    ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` to ensure the administrator has a role on the
    project and system.

    [`bug 968696 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/968696>`_]
    The work to introduce `system-scope <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/system-scope>`_
    in addition to associating `scope types <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/specs/queens/include-scope-in-policy.html>`_
    to operations with ``oslo.policy`` will give project developers the ability
    to fix `bug 968696 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/968696>`_.

    [`bug 1749268 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1749268>`_]
    The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command now ensures that an administrator
    has a system role assignment. This prevents the ability for operators to
    lock themselves out of system-level APIs.
