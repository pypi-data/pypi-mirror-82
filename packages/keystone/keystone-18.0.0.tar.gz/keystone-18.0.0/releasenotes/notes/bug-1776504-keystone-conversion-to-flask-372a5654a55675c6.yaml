    Keystone has been fully converted to run under flask. All of the APIs are
    now natively dispatched under flask.

    Included in this change is a removal of a legacy WSGI environment data
    holder calld `openstack.params`. The data holder was used exclusively for
    communicating data down the chain under paste-deploy. The data in
    `openstack.params` was generally "normalized" in an odd way and
    unreferenced in the rest of the openstack code-base.

    Some minor changes to the JSON Home document occured to make it consistent
    with the rest of our convensions (Technically an API contract break) but
    required for the more strict view the Keystone flask code takes on setting
    up the values for JSON Home. Notably "application_credentials" now has
    an appropriate entry for listing and creating new app creds.

    JSON Body and URL Normalizing middleware were move to a flask-native
    model.

    Any middleware defined in Keystone's tree is no longer loaded via
    stevedore, and likewise the entry points were removed.

    Original WSGI Framework (custom, home-rolled, based on WEBOB) has been
    removed from the codebase.
