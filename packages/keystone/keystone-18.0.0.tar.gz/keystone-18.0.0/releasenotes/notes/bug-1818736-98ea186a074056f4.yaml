    The ``identity:get_limit``, ``identity:list_limits`` and
    ``identity:get_limit_model`` policies now support domain scope, so domain
    users are now able to get limit information on their own domains as well as
    see the limit model in effect.

    [`bug 1818736 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1818736>`_]
    The ``identity:get_limit`` policy default check string has been changed to
    support domain scope. This policy are not being formally deprecated because
    the unified limits API is still considered experimental. These
    new default automatically account for domain scope in addition to system
    scope. Please consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides the
    limit policies.
