    A Federated user gets an entry in the shadow-users table. This
    entry has a unique ID. It was generated using a UUID. This fix
    changes to reuse the mechanism for LDAP, where the ID is generated
    from the domain ID + the local id of the user (an attribute that
    uniquely ids the user from the IdP). This generator is specified
    by the configuration file. Now Both LDAP and Federated Ids are
    generated the same way. It also means that Federated IDs can be
    kept in sync between two independtent Keystone servers.
