Getting Involved
================

The OpenStack community is a very friendly group and there are places online to
join in with the community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points
you to some of the places where you can communicate with people.

How to Join the Community
=========================

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
and there are no formal membership requirements. The best way to join the
community is to talk with others online or at a meetup and offer contributions
through Launchpad_, the wiki_, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,
from feature designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts.
