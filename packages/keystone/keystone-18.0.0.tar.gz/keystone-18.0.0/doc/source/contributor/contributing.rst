So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Keystone.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For communicating with Keystone Team, you can `reach out`_ to us through mailing lists
and IRC channels.

For any help contact `keystone maintainers`_ , the core team of keystone.

on, search for the `low-hanging-fruit`_ tag in `bugs launchpad`_.
