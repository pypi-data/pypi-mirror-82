Filtering responsibilities between API resources and drivers
============================================================

Keystone supports the specification of filtering on list queries as part of the
v3 identity API. By default these queries are satisfied in the API resource when
it calls the ``wrap_collection`` method at the end of a ``get`` method.  However,
to enable optimum performance, any driver can implement some or all of the specified
filters (for example, by adding filtering to the generated SQL statements to generate
the list).

The communication of the filter details between the API resource and its drivers is
handled by the passing of a reference to a Hints object, which is a list of dicts
describing the filters. A driver that satisfies a filter must delete the filter from
the Hints object so that when it is returned to the API, it knows to only execute any
unsatisfied filters.

The contract for a driver for ``list_{entity}`` methods is therefore:

* It MUST return a list of entities of the specified type
* It MAY either just return all such entities, or alternatively reduce the
  list by filtering for one or more of the specified filters in the passed
  Hints reference, and removing any such satisfied filters. An exception to
  this is that for identity drivers that support domains, then they should
  at least support filtering by domain_id.
