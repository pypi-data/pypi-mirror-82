SYNOPSIS
========

  keystone-manage [options]

DESCRIPTION
===========

``keystone-manage`` is the command line tool which interacts with the Keystone
service to initialize and update data within Keystone. Generally,
``keystone-manage`` is only used for operations that cannot be accomplished
with the HTTP API, such data import/export and database migrations.

USAGE
=====

    ``keystone-manage [options] action [additional args]``

.. include:: commands.rst

OPTIONS
=======

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config-dir DIR      Path to a config directory to pull \*.conf files from.
                        This file set is sorted, so as to provide a
                        predictable parse order if individual options are
                        over-ridden. The set is parsed after the file(s)
                        specified via previous --config-file, arguments hence
                        over-ridden options in the directory take precedence.
  --config-file PATH    Path to a config file to use. Multiple config files
                        can be specified, with values in later files taking
                        precedence. Defaults to None.
  --debug, -d           If set to true, the logging level will be set to DEBUG
                        instead of the default INFO level.
  --log-config-append PATH, --log_config PATH
                        The name of a logging configuration file. This file is
                        appended to any existing logging configuration files.
                        For details about logging configuration files, see the
                        Python logging module documentation. Note that when
                        logging configuration files are used then all logging
                        configuration is set in the configuration file and
                        other logging configuration options are ignored (for
                        example, logging_context_format_string).
  --log-date-format DATE_FORMAT
                        Defines the format string for %(asctime)s in log
                        records. Default: None . This option is ignored if
                        log_config_append is set.
  --log-dir LOG_DIR, --logdir LOG_DIR
                        (Optional) The base directory used for relative
                        log_file paths. This option is ignored if
                        log_config_append is set.
  --log-file PATH, --logfile PATH
                        (Optional) Name of log file to send logging output to.
                        If no default is set, logging will go to stderr as
                        defined by use_stderr. This option is ignored if
                        log_config_append is set.
  --nodebug             The inverse of --debug
  --nostandard-threads  The inverse of --standard-threads
  --nouse-syslog        The inverse of --use-syslog
  --noverbose           The inverse of --verbose
  --nowatch-log-file    The inverse of --watch-log-file
  --pydev-debug-host PYDEV_DEBUG_HOST
                        Host to connect to for remote debugger.
  --pydev-debug-port PYDEV_DEBUG_PORT
                        Port to connect to for remote debugger.
  --standard-threads    Do not monkey-patch threading system modules.
  --syslog-log-facility SYSLOG_LOG_FACILITY
                        Syslog facility to receive log lines. This option is
                        ignored if log_config_append is set.
  --use-syslog          Use syslog for logging. Existing syslog format is
                        DEPRECATED and will be changed later to honor RFC5424.
                        This option is ignored if log_config_append is set.
  --verbose, -v         If set to false, the logging level will be set to
                        WARNING instead of the default INFO level.
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --watch-log-file      Uses logging handler designed to watch file system.
                        When log file is moved or removed this handler will
                        open a new log file with specified path
                        instantaneously. It makes sense only if log_file
                        option is specified and Linux platform is used. This
                        option is ignored if log_config_append is set.
