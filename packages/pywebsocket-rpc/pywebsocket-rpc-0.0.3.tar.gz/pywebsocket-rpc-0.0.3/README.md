# WebsocketRPC
This project is a proof of concept for implementing RPC over websockets.

# Getting Started

You can install the package by running:
```
pip install pywebsocket_rpc
```

Then, import the package:
```
import pywebsocket_rpc
```
The client program will prompt for input messages, which it will send to the server. The server will respond in the pattern:
{input_message}/answer.
