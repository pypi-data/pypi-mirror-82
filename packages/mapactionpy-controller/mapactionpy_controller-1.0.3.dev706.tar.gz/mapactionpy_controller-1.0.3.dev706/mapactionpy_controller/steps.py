    This represents the atomic "unit of work" within the map production automation.

    The contract for functions
        'state' - An object of any kind. Either generated by the previous Step or passed as the `initial_state`
                  parameter of `main_stack.process_stack` function.

    Return values:
        Any object. Does not need to be a dict. The return value will be wrapped in the dict prior to being
        passed to the next step.  kwargs = {'state' : return_value}

    Exceptions:

            pass_back['result'] = result
            pass_back['exp'] = exp
            pass_back['stack_trace'] = traceback.format_exc()


    :param func:
        * Must accept a **kwargs param. If there is a state object this is passed as `kwargs['state']`.
          The stack does not guarentee the type of object that will be passed as the state.
        * If the function completes successfully it should return the updated state object. This should be
          "bare" (ie not wrapped in a dict ala kwargs)
        * If the function does not complete successfully it should raise an exception.
    :param fail_threshold: Expresses the severity with which an exception from `func` should be treated. In
        any case the exception will be handled and a JIRA tasks logged as appropriate.
        * If = `logging.ERROR` - the exception will terminate the program.
        * If = `logging.WARNING` - the exception will not result in termination. A JRIA task will be logged the
          program will attempt to continue, though the results may not be want the user intended.
