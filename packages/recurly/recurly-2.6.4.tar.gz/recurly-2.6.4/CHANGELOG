### Upgrade Notes

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.8. There is one breaking change:

When more than one error appears for a given key, the value will become a list. See
[PR](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-python/pull/208) and the [original issue](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-python/issues/197)
for more details.

## Version 2.5.0 April 17, 2017

- Remove parsing of X-Records header
- Cardless Free Trial changes for 2.6

### Upgrade Notes

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.6. There are two breaking changes:

1. Since the X-Records header was removed in the pagination endpoint, you can no longer call `len()` on a Page and expect it to return a cached response.
From now on you need to explicitly call the `count()` class method on a Page. See [PR #202](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-python/pull/202) for more information.
2. For `POST /v2/subscriptions` Sending `None` for `total_billing_cycles` attribute will now override plan `total_billing_cycles` setting and will make subscription renew forever.
Omitting the attribute will cause the setting to default to the value of plan `total_billing_cycles`.
