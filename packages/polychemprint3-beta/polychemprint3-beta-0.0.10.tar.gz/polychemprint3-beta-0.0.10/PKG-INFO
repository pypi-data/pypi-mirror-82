Description: # PolyChemPrint3
        Free and Open Source 3D Printer control software targeted at 
        Research Users (Polymer/Paste/BioPrinting)
        Written in/for Python 3.3+ (but may work on others)
        
        This software was initially written by Bijal Patel from 2017-2019 as 
        an object-oriented cross-platform tool and successor to 
        PolyPrint, a Perl script.
        
        Within our lab (Diao Group at the University of Illinois 
        http://diao.scs.illinois.edu/Diao_Lab/Home.html) 
        we have succesfully used it to print solutions for organic 
        semiconductors/conductors, polymer photonics, hydrogels, chocolate, etc. 
        
        The software is written to be convenient for researchers with 
        features like automatic data logging, parameterized shapes, and 
        convenient macros.
        
        Please cite the following papers if you make use of this software 
        in your research!
