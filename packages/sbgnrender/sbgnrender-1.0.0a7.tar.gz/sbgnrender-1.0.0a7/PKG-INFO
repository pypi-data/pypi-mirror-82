        # SBGNRender Python library
        This library is using Selenium to control ChromeDriver, to run a JS website rendering SBGN (based on Newt)
        
        To install it, the simplest way is via PyPI :
        ```
        sudo pip3 install sbgnrender
        ```
        
        After installing the library, usage is the following : 
        ```
        from sbgnrender import renderSBGN
        
        renderSBGN(
            input_file,  // Path as a string
            output_file, // Path as a string
            format,      // Format as a string : svg, png, jpg
            scale,       // Scale of the network (default 1 for svg, 3 for jpg/png)
            bg,          // Background color as HTML String (ex #fff for white), None for transparent (available for png/svg),
            max_width,   // Maximum width in pixels
            min_width,   // Minimum width in pixels
            quality,     // Quality (available for jpg),
            layout,      // Perform automatic layout
            verbose      // True | False
        )
        ```
        
        This library depends on ChromeDriver, which can be installed on ubuntu/debian systems with 
        ```
        sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver
        ```
        
        On Ubuntu 19.x and later, chromium installation is using snap package manager, which causes a problem while writing and accessing temporary files. The current workaround is to change chromium temporary directory permissions with : 
        ```
        sudo chmod 711 /tmp/snap.chromium
        ```
        This is just a temporary which you will have to do at startup (after having run chrome at least once) everytime. If somebody knows a trick, contributions are welcome
