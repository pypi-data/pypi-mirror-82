    Parameters
    ----------

        Does the data actually have an indirect dimension?
        If not, assume that there is a constant echo time,
        that can be retrieved with ``.get_prop('te')``.
    truncate : bool
        If this is set, `register_axis <pyspecdata.axis_manipulation.register_axis>` to :math:`t_{direct}=0`,
        and then throw out the data for which :math:`t_{direct}<0`.
