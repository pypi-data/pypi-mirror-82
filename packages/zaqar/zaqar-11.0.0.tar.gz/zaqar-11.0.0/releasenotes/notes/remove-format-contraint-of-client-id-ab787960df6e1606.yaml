features:
  - Since some clients use different format of client id not only uuid, like
    user id of ldap, so Zaqar will remove the format contrain of client id.
    Add one option 'client_id_uuid_safe' to allow user to control the
    validation of client id. Add two options 'min_length_client_id' and
    'max_length_client_id' to allow user to control the length of client id
    if not using uuid. This also requires user to ensure the client id is
    immutable.
