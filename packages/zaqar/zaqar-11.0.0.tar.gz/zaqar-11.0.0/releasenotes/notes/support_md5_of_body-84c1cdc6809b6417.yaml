    Support non-URL encoded message body checksum function, the default algorithm
    is MD5. Back-end support for MongoDB, Redis and Swift. With this feature, when
    a user sends a message to the queue, Zaqar calculates a "checksum" value for
    the body of the non-URL encoded message, which the user can then get after the
    message is got or claimed. Finally, the user can use it to verify that the
    body of the newly obtained message is correct.
