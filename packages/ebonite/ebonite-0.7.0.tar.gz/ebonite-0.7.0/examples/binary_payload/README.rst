Binary Payload Example
======================

This example shows how to create a model that consumes binary object (image file).
This is useful for DL models.

Run `python serve.py` to run flask service.

After that, you can run `python client.py %some_img_url%`
to call your model or go to `http://localhost:9000/apidocs`
