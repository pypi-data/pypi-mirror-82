# Project Description

`gsheetgraph` is a small wrapper around the *Google Sheet* which provide the facility of ploting of graph by selecting the X-axes and Y-axes.

The data of the sheet can also be manipulated using this package.
***
## Installation 
>pip install gsheetgraph
***
## How to use it?
Import the package into the program. _gsheetgraph_ contain a module *gsheet_api* which contain the methods for ploting the graph as well as manipulating the data of the sheet.

Once the module is imported it will ask to share the *Google Sheet* with the provided address. In the backend the user file will be linked with the *Google spread sheet api*.
Once the file will succesfully shared the connection will be established to perform the task. 

---

Create the object for the connection:
```python
>>> from gsheetgraph import gsheet_api as ap
>>> con= ap.gsheetconnection()
```
>Note: Once the object will be created it will ask to share google sheet with the provided address and also ask for the sheet name.

Get all the data from sheet
```python
>>> con.getAllData()
```
Get the data of a specified row and col 
```python
# Accept the row number or col as an argument 

>>> con.getRowValues(2)
>>> con.getColValues(4)
```
Get the cell values 
```python
# Accept the cell index as an argumet 

>>> con.getCellValues(2,3)
```
Insert the data into the sheet
```python
# Accept row number and list of data to be inserted.

>>> con.insertRow(3,[1,"abc"]) 
```
Delete the Rows
```python
# Accepts start and end index to be deleted

>>> con.deleteRow(2,4)
```
Plot the Graph 
```python
# Choose X-axes and y-axes 
>>> con.plotGraph()

# After selecting the X-axesa and Y-axes choose the type of the graph  

```
