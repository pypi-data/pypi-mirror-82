    You can submit up to 10 messages in a single request, but you must always
    encapsulate the messages in a collection container (an array in JSON, even
    for a single message - without the JSON array, you receive the "Invalid
    request body" message). The resulting value of the Location header or
    response body might be used to retrieve the created messages for further
    processing.
  </p>
  <p translate>
    The client specifies only the body and TTL for the message. The server
    inserts metadata, such as ID and age.

    See a sample as below:

  <pre translate>
[
  {
    "body": {
      "event": "BackupProgress",
      "current_bytes": "2341134",
      "total_bytes": "99614720"
    }
  }
]
