Description: Sweetener
        =========
        
        Sweetener is a Python library that contains some generic algorithms and data
        structures. Extra care has been taken to make the algorithms as flexible as
        possible to fit as many use cases. If you're still missing something, do not
        hesitate to file an [issue][1]!
        
        In particular, this library contains the following goodies:
        
          - **Generic procedures** like `clone`, `equal` and `lte` that work on most
            types in the standard library and you can specialize for your own types.
          - A **typed record type** that allows you to very quickly define a new data
            structure with some built-in validation.
          - A **generic representation for parse trees** that allows you to define,
            query and manipulate individual nodes with ease.

        ## Examples
        
        ```py
        from sweetener import Record, equal, visualize
        
        class MySimpleRecord(Record):
            field_1: int
            field_2: str
        
        r1 = MySimpleRecord('foo', 42)
        r2 = MySimpleRecod(field_1='foo', field_2=42)
        
        assert(equal(r1, r2))
        
        visualize(r1)
        ```
