        ========
        
        Incoming requests, outgoing queries, and messages being passed around often contain 
        data that needs be normalized to account for things like missing data, types, 
        or default values. This is a simple tool for generating boilerplate for data objects. 
        
        Notes:
         - Tries to be inplace, the dict you start with should still exist with the structure+type corrections applied.
         - Let IDEs check type annotations and attribute spelling.
         - Let you annotate fields with metadata that other systems may need in order to process the document properly.
         - Properties and methods are copied in.
