Draughts
========

Incoming requests, outgoing queries, and messages being passed around often contain 
data that needs be normalized to account for things like missing data, types, 
or default values. This is a simple tool for generating boilerplate for data objects. 

Notes:
 - Tries to be inplace, the dict you start with should still exist with the structure+type corrections applied.
 - Let IDEs check type annotations and attribute spelling.
 - Let you annotate fields with metadata that other systems may need in order to process the document properly.
 - Properties and methods are copied in.
