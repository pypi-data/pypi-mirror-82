Graphility pure python, NoSQL, fast database
============================================

Graphility is based on CodernityDB by `Codernity Labs`_

Graphility is opensource, pure python (no 3rd party dependency), fast (really fast check Speed in documentation if you don't believe in words), multiplatform, schema-less, `NoSQL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL>`_ database. It has optional support for HTTP server version (Graphility-HTTP), and also Python client library (Graphility-PyClient) that aims to be 100% compatible with embeded version.

You can call it a more advanced key-value database. With multiple key-values indexes in the same engine. Also Graphility supports functions that are executed inside database.

Documentation in repo still refers to CodernityDB and will be updated at the end of reconstruction process.

Reconstruction
--------------

As of 2020 the original CodernityDB has been neglected for quite some time and the original repo has been lost.

`Nick M.`_ already started porting CodernityDB to Python 3. Go to his repo to see progress.
I'll try to backport any changes he makes but I cant' guarantee anything.

I decided to make my own port because I want to tear it down and rebuild it piece by piece using only Python 3.8+.
You know, to fully know the internals. I also want to add graph layer on top of it.
Also, Apache 2.0 License requires me to change the name of the project since "CodernityDB"
is a trademark/servicemark of Codernity_.


Key features
------------

* Native python database
* Multiple indexes
* Fast (more than 50 000 insert operations per second see Speed in documentation for details)
* Embeded mode (default). REST Server and client are planned.
* Easy way to implement custom Storage
* Sharding support
