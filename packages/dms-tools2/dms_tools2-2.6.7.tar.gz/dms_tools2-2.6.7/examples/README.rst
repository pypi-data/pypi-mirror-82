Example analyses with ``dms_tools2``
=========================================

Each subdirectory contains a separate analysis.

Typically the analysis is performed by a `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ (e.g., ``analysis_notebook.ipynb``).
Full details of each analysis are provided in the notebooks, and each subdirectory has a README file.
