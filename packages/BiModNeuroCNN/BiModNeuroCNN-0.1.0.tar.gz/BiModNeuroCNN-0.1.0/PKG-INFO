Description: **BiModNeuroCNN**
        
        This is a package for training bimodal deep learning archtectures on dual streams 
        of neurological data. Package tested on Electroencephalography (EEG) and 
        function near-infrared stpectroscopy (fNIRS).
        
        Work in progress - more to be added in future.
