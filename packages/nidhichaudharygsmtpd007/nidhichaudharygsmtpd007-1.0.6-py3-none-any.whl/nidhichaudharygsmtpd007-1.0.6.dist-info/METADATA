Library: nidhichaudharygsmtpd007

This library helps in taking the google sheets and can even convert the sheets into the pandas dataframe and then it can use this dataframe to plot it into 3 different forms of graphs:
1. Bar plot
2. Line Plot with markers and dotted line
3. Scatter Plot with the mean line and the color.

** Details of each functions are described below

1. To call the google spreadsheet:
    - Use createcredentials() for this purpose:

            createcredentials('your api json filename', 'spreadsheet to be called')
        Put the full path for the api json filename
    - It returns the list of the dictionary from the called spreadsheet.

2. To convert the list of dictionary returned from the createcredentials() to dataframe:
    - Use createDF() for this purpose:

            createDF(d) 
                - d: the returned list of dictionary
    - Returns the dataframe that can be used for plotting.

3. To plot the graphs of your choice:
    - Currently the library provides you to plot 3 graphs: Bar Plot, Line Plot, Scatter Plot.

    - For Barlplot you need to call:

            plotBar(dataframe, 'column name for the x axis', 'column name for the y axis')
        - The function automatically plots the graph for you.

    - For Lineplot you need to call:

            plotLine(dataframe, 'column name for the x axis', 'column name for the y axis')
         - The function plots the graph which is represented by the dotted line and the points are marked by the '>' symbol.

    - For Scatterplot you need to call:

            plotScatter(dataframe, 'column name for the x axis', 'column name for the y axis', colors)
            colors: Array for designing the colorbar.
        - The function returns the Scatterplot which is represented by the green color and along with it there shall be a color bar which describes the  variation of color throughout the plotting of graph. Along with that mean is also plotted with that.

    Note: All figures can be easily saved.

    Pre-Requisites:
    1. Google API for spreadsheets

    For creating this library I have used gspread for calling the google spreadsheet api.
