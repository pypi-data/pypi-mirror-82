        ``filter-profanity`` is one of the most efficient python packages that provides functionality to censor profanity in text! The package cross-verifies text with a list of opensource profane vocabulary that you can find [here](https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words).
        
        This package can be used in many areas including chat applications, bots and anything that handles user input!
        
        ## Installation
        Installing ``filter-profanity`` is as easy as running ``pip install filter-profanity``!
        
        ## Usage
        We've developed ``filter-profanity`` to make it as easy as possible to utilize.
        
        Currently, ``filter-profanity`` provides two functions - ``censor_profanity`` and ``has_profanity``
        
        ``censor_profanity(text, optional_censor)`` takes in two arguments, the text that it scans for profanity and an optional censor to replace profane language with. If you do not provide a censor, we default to ``*``. Here's an example -
        ```
        from profanity import censor_profanity
        
        print(censor_profanity("This code is definitely not sh!t"))
        # Prints -
        # This code is definitely not ****
        ```
        
        ``has_profanity(text)`` takes in one argument- the text that it must check for profanity. If the provided text has any profane content, it returns ``True`` otherwise it conditionally returns ``False``. Here's an example -
        ```
        from profanity import has_profanity
        
        print(has_profanity("This code is definitely not sh!t"))
        # Prints -
        # True
        ```
