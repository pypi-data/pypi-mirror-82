upgrade:
  - The concept of built-in monasca-notification plugins has been removed
    and the built-in plugins are no longer pre-populated in the database. If
    you were using the PAGERDUTY, EMAIL or WEBHOOK notification plugin you
    should explicitly enable it in the monasca-notification config file.
