    Allow metric_dimensions filter to filter on multiple dimension values,
    on alarms count endpoint (IE metric_dimension=hostname:host1|host2).
    This brings the query parameters into parity between the alarms list
    and alarms count endpoints. This also restores functionality that was
    available on the deprecated java api.
