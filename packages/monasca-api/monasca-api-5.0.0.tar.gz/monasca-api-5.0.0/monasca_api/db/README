This directory contains the plumbing for the Alembic migrations that modify the
Monasca database.

If you need to add a new migration, run

  alembic revision -m '<revision message>'

in this directory, where <revision message> is a short description for what
your migration does such as 'Add volume field to alarm'. Alembic will then
create a revision script in the alembic/versions/ directory. You will need to
edit this script to add upwards and downwards migrations for the change you
want to make.
