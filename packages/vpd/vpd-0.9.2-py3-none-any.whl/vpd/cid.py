"""
This implementation of CaseInsensitiveDict is taken from the python requests library.

Although some modifications were made, they were generally trivial. Given the ubiquitous
nature of requests, it would've been reasonable to just depend on the upstream code, but
it seemed inappropriate to risk upstream changes breaking code with changes across versions.
This seemed extremely relevant because the previous version of this code that was used in
a few places was from an older implementation that used upper-cased keys instead of
lower-cased keys. This type of change could break augmenting code. Therefore, it made
sense to reproduce it here to prevent version-related breaking changes.

"""

from collections import Mapping, MutableMapping, OrderedDict


class CaseInsensitiveDict(MutableMapping):
    """A case-insensitive ``dict``-like object.

    Implements all methods and operations of
    ``MutableMapping`` as well as dict's ``copy``. Also
    provides ``lower_items``.

    All keys are expected to be strings. The structure remembers the
    case of the last key to be set, and ``iter(instance)``,
    ``keys()``, ``items()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``iteritems()``
    will contain case-sensitive keys. However, querying and contains
    testing is case insensitive::

        cid = CaseInsensitiveDict()
        cid['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        cid['aCCEPT'] == 'application/json'  # True
        list(cid) == ['Accept']  # True

    For example, ``headers['content-encoding']`` will return the
    value of a ``'Content-Encoding'`` response header, regardless
    of how the header name was originally stored.

    If the constructor, ``.update``, or equality comparison
    operations are given keys that have equal ``.lower()``s, the
    behavior is undefined.
