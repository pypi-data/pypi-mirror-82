        Run the Jupyter notebook server as a little app in the system tray. 
        
        That way you don't have to keep a separate command window open just for the server.
        
        <img src="https://img.icons8.com/windows/32/000000/windows-10.png"/> This app is made for Windows.
        
        (It should be portable to Mac/Linux, as the GUI uses the cross-platform 'Qt' framework.
        Pull requests for such a port are welcome).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Make sure PyQt5 is installed:
        ```
        conda install pyqt
        ```
        
        Then run:
        ```
        pip install jupytray
        ```
        This will get you the
        [![latest version on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupytray.svg?label=latest%20version%20on%20PyPI:)](https://pypi.org/project/jupytray/)
        
        Finally, run
        ```
        jupytray-shortcuts install
        ```
        This will add shortcuts to the Windows Start menu and Startup folder.
        
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Open the Start menu, type `Jupytray`, and hit enter.
        
        This should start the tray app and the Jupyter notebook server.
        
        The app will also auto-run at system restarts. (This can be disabled in the settings menu).
        
        
        ## Deinstallation
        
        First remove the Windows shortcuts:
        ```
        jupytray-shortcuts uninstall
        ```
        Then remove the Python package:
        ```
        pip uninstall jupytray
        ```
