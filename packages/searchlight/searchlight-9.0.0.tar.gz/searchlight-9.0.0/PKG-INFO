        Welcome!
        ========
        
        The Searchlight project provides indexing and search capabilities across
        OpenStack resources. Its goal is to achieve high performance and flexible
        querying combined with near real-time indexing. It uses Elasticsearch, a
        real-time distributed indexing and search engine built on Apache Lucene, but
        adds OpenStack authentication and Role Based Access Control to provide
        appropriate protection of data.
