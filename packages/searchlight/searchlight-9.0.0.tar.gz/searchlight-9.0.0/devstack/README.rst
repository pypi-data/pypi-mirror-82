=================================
 Enabling Searchlight in Devstack
=================================

1. Download DevStack (git clone)

2. Update local.conf

You may follow the customization instructions below or use the example
local.conf.

3. Run ``stack.sh``

.. note::
   This installs a headless JRE. If you are working on a desktop based OS
   (such as Ubuntu 14.04), this may cause tools like pycharms to no longer
   launch. You can switch between JREs and back: to a headed JRE version using:
   "sudo update-alternatives --config java".


Full example local.conf
=======================

The example `local.conf.example <local.conf.example>`_ MAY not be up to date
with the rest of devstack.

.. note::
   You will need to look through the settings and potentially customize it to
   your environment, especially ``HOST_IP``.

Existing local.conf customization
=================================

1. Add this repo as an external repository::

     > cat local.conf
     [[local|localrc]]
     enable_plugin searchlight https://opendev.org/openstack/searchlight
     enable_service searchlight-api
     enable_service searchlight-listener

   To use stable branches, make sure devstack is on that branch, and specify
   the branch name to enable_plugin, for example::

     enable_plugin searchlight https://opendev.org/openstack/searchlight stable/mitaka

2. Configure desired searchlight plugins

The search service is driven using a plugin mechanism for integrating to other
services. Each integrated service may need to be specifically enabled
in devstack and may require additional configuration settings to work with
searchlight. For example, you typically will need to set the notifications
driver in each service's configuration.

Please review the plugin documentation and add configuration appropriately:

 * `Searchlight Plugins <https://docs.openstack.org/searchlight/latest/configuration/plugins.html>`_

3. Customize searchlight configuration

Searchlight documentation talks about settings in ``searchlight.conf``.
To customize searchlight.conf settings, add them under the following
section in ``local.conf``::

    [[post-config|$SEARCHLIGHT_CONF]]
