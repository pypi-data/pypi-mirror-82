    When user requests a reindex by specifying --type
    parameter, searchlight may copy existing Elasticsearch
    data to reindex, if these old indices or type mappings
    are missing, newly created indices will have incomplete
    resource data.

fixes:
  - Fix a bug that incomplete types may be copyed during
    reindex. Add checks about data integrity before copying
    existing Elasticsearch data, warn user if there is any
    missing index or type mapping and exit. Users can
    suppress exit behavior by using force parameter.
