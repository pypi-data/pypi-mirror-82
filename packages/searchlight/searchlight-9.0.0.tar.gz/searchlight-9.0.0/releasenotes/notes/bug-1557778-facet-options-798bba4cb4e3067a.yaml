    Disable returning options for the facet fields.
features:
  - Currently the "facet" endpoint will return all
    information relating to a facet field, including
    the options. The new parameter "exclude_options"
    to the facet endpoint will prevent the options
    for all facet fields from being returned. This option
    will avoid an aggregation query being performed
    on Elasticsearch, improving performance. The default
    behavior (not specifying this option) is return the
    options for all facet fields.
