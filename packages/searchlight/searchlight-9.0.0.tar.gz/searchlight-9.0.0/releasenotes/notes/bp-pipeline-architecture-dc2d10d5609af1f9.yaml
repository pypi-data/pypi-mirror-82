    Introduce a pipeline architecture to configure
    publishers for resource plugins.
features:
  - Publishers can be configured at plugin level or
    top level in configuration file. When Searchlight
    does incremental updates via notifications,
    configured publishers will receive information
    about modified resources and publish them to subscribers
    outside Searchlight.
