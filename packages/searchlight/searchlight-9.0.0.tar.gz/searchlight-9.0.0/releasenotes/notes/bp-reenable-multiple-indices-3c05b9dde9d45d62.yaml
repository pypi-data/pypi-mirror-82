    The ability to distribute resource type indexing across resource groups has now
    been fully enabled. This allows for improved indexing speed and clustering customization.
features:
  - Reenabled multiple indices by allowing plugins to be
    managed under different resource groups.
issues:
  - Using multiple resource groups will impact sort behavior when sorting on fields
    across resource types when all the resource types don't have the requested 'sort-by field'.
