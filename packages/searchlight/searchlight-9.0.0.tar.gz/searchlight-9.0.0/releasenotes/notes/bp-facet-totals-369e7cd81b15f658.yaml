    Adds the ability to attain a document count per
    resource type from the /facets endpoint. Doc count
    is always returned for a type; field listing is optional.
features:
  - Includes 'doc_count' in /facets response for each
    resource type.
issues:
  - This is a change that is not compatible with the API
    response in Mitaka; changes have been made in Newton to
    the python client and UI.
upgrade:
  - A version of python-searchlightclient greater than 2.1
    must be used with this change, as well as the Newton
    UI version.
