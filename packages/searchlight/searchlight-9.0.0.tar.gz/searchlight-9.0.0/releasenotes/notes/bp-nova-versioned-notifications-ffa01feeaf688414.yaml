prelude: >
    Adds support for versioned nova server notifications.
features:
  - |
    Support for versioned nova server notifications (and related notifications
    where supported, like volume attach). This has to be enabled (it is not
    yet the default).

    This reduces the callbacks to the nova API significantly.
issues:
  - |
    Payload versioning is somewhat manual; a given release will support a
    maxmimum major payload version and warn on later minor versions.
upgrade:
  - |
    Configuration needs changing to support versioned notifications; see docs.
