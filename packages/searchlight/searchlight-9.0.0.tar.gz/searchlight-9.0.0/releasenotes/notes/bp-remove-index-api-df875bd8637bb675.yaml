prelude: >
    Remove the 'index' API. It is currently a passthrough
    to elasticsearch, allowing direct index access and
    bypassing any document transforms. As such it is
    dangerous, and only marginally useful. Administrators
    wishing to do this should do so directly in Elasticsearch.
features:
  - Removes the /index api and related tests. If an admin
    needs to directly modify data in Elasticsearch they
    should do so in Elasticsearch.
security:
  - Removes the admin-only '/index' api, which allowed
    an unnecessary amount of access to Elasticsearch.
