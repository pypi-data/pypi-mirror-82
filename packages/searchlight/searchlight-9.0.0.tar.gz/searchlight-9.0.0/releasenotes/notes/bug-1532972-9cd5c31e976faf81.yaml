  A fix for a couple of parent-child plugin relationship
  issues related to initial indexing. Child plugins can
  no longer be indexed separately from their parents.

fixes:
  - Child plugins cannot be indexed on their own, only as
    a result of indexing their parent. This fixes an issue
    whereby indexing only a parent plugin could leave orphaned
    children (or vice versa).
  - Applies mappings for parent/child plugins simultaneously.
    Under elasticsearch 2.x, child mappings must be created at
    the same time or before parents, not the other way round.
