  The initial mitaka release (0.2) did not support
  ElasticSearch 2.x. ElasticSearch made several changes
  to internal index data mappings that were not
  backwards compatible with ElasticSearch 1.x. This
  release has all the changes required for Searchlight
  to support both ElasticSearch 1.x and 2.x.

  Searchlight now supports oslo pools instead of requiring
  a different topic for each listener. This simplifies deployment
  configuration. Previously, services would have to be specifically
  configured to send notifications to the Searchlight topic. With
  this change, Searchlight can share topics with other services
  such as Ceilometer.
upgrade:
  - To support ElasticSearch 1.x and 2.x, several internal data
    mappings have been updated. If you previously deployed Searchlight,
    you will need to reindex your resource data using
    ``searchlight-manage index sync``. You may re-index everything
    or limit it to ``OS::Nova::Server``, ``OS::Glance::Image``,
    ``OS::Glance::Metadef``, ``OS::Cinder:Volume``,
    and ``OS::Cinder::Snapshot``.

    To start using a pool with a shared topic instead of separate topics:

    * Update the respective service configuration files for searchlight
      enabled plugins to only publish to a single topic
      (e.g. set ``notification_topics = notifications``). If you have
      Ceilometer enabled, this must be the same topic which Ceilometer uses.
      You also typically must restart each service for the change to
      take effect. For example, in ``nova.conf``, ``glance-api.conf``,
      ``cinder.conf``, ``neutron.conf``, and ``designate.conf``:

    ::

      notification_topics = notifications

    * Update ``searchlight.conf``. In the ``[resource_plugin]`` section, set
      ``notifications_topic`` to  match the shared topic that you set in the
      service configurations. In the ``[listener]`` sections, set
      ``notifications_pool`` to your desired pool name. The default name
      starting in Newton is ``searchlight``. The ``notifications_pool`` does
      not have to match anything from other services configuration files.
      For example:

    ::

      [resource_plugin]
      notifications_topic = notifications

      [listener]
      notifications_pool = searchlight
