features:
  - Adds nova plugin for server groups.
issues:
  - There are no notifications for server groups from nova yet,
    so we recommend putting it in its own resource group and
    scheduling a cron job to periodically re-sync. This will
    create a very low overhead way to keep the index up to
    date. The index latency will be dependent on how often you
    re-sync the data.
