prelude: >
  In order to allow policy files to more be useful
  in Searchlight, we now support limited control over
  individual resource types via oslo policy control.
features:
  - Policy rules can now be specified per resource type
    and per operation per resource type.
issues:
  - RBAC is still separate from policy restriction; this
    is targeted for the Newton release.
