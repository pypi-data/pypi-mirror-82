    Adds support for service policy files. Simplifies existing
    API policy support.
features:
  - API configuration can include service policy files such
    that access to various resources can match whether their
    service API allows access for a user.
upgrade:
  - The existing searchlight policy.json has been simplified.
    The only supported options for resource policy are to enable
    or disable it for all request types (i.e. the 'allow', 'query'
    'facet' suffixes are no longer in effect).
