  Added multi-thread support for indexing.
features:
  - When searchlight-manage is indexing, all resource types will be indexed in
    a separate thread. Multiple threads will be run concurrently.
other:
  - The maximum number of threads that will run concurrently can be controlled
    by setting "max_workers" in the Searchlight configuration file.

    [manage]
    max_workers = 6
