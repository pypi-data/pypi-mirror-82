  Ability added to reindex data while allowing indexing
  of notifications, and therefore returning accurate
  search results during the indexing operation.
features:
  - Reindexing of data now takes place in a separate
    Elasticsearch index. During indexing, incoming events
    are processed into both the old and new indices.
    Once indexing is complete, an Elasticsearch alias is
    used to switch searches seamlessly onto the new index,
    at which time the old one is removed.
  - Plugin configuration refers to `resource_group_name`
    rather than `index_name` to represent groups of
    resources separate from the logical Elasticsearch index.
    This setting is used to determine index and alias names.
issues:
  - Reindexing must now take place across all resource
    types that share the index (it is not possible to re-index
    a specific resource type). This is a limitation that
    Elasticsearch 2.x would likely have forced upon us anyway.
    A subsequent patch will allow more efficient reindexing
    for associated resource types.
