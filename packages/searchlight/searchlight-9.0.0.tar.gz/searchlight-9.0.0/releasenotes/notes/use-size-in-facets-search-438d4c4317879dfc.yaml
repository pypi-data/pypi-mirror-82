    Change the way of doing facets search, replace use of
    search_type=count with size=0
other:
  - Facets search is aggregation-only, no actual documents
    need to be returned. We do it by setting search_type
    in search request before, but it has been deprecated in
    Elasticsearch 2.x, use recommended size=0 instead.
