features:
  - Adds neutron plugins for networks, subnets, ports
    and routers.
issues:
  - Neutron resources do not provide dates (created_at
    or updated_at). created_at is left empty; updated_at
    is taken from the server (and will be adjusted to
    use the notification timestamp at a later time)
