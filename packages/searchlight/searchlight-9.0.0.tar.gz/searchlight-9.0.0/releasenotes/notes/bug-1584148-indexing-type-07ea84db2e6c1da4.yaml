  No longer index the data of child plugins as part of
  indexing a parent plugin, which fixes ConflictErrors
  occurring specifying parent plugins as the argument
  to searchlight-manage index sync --type.
fixes:
  - Bug 1584148 Version conflict during re-indexing
other:
  - In mitaka, indexing a parent plugin also reindexed the
    data for any children it had. That is no longer the case.
