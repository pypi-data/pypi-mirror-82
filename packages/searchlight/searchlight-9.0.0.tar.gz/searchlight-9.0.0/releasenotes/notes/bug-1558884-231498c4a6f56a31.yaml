    Correct facet options on analyzed string fields.
fixes:
  - Facet options don't work well with analyzed string
    fields, because the aggregation runs on tokens.
    These fields have non-analyzed raw subfields for
    sorting. Include raw subfields in facet results so
    that users can use them to do exact matches.
