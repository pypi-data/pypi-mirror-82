prelude: >
  Added separation of administrator-only data at an index
  level, which allows full faceting and searching of
  sensitive data by those with access to it.
features:
  - Plugins with sensitive, administrator-only data are
    indexed twice; once with that data and once without.
    Searches are directed to the appropriate version
    depending on the context of the user.
