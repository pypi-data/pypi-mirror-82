features:
  - Notifications for flavor are now supported.
issues:
  - The projects list will not present in the flavor related
    versioned notifications if you update the flavor access only
    because of a lazy-loaded bug in nova.
upgrade:
  - To enable the notifications for flavor you need to config
    `notifications_topics_exchanges = versioned_notifications,nova`
    under section `resource_plugin:os_nova_flavor`
