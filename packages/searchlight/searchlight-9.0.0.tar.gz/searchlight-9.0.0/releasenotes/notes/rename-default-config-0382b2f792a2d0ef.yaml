    The default config file for searchlight was searchlight-api.conf despite
    the fact that this config file was used by both the API and the listener
    processes. Therefore, we decided to rename the default config file to
    searchlight.conf. This change also prompted us to to follow the convention
    used by many other projects and simplify searchlight-api-paste.ini to
    api-paste.ini.
upgrade:
  - During an upgrade to Mitaka, operators must rename the previous configured
    searchlight-api.conf to searchlight.conf and searchlight-api-paste.ini
    to api-paste.ini.
