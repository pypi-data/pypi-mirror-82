  Fix the information returned by the API plugins endpoint.
deprecations:
  - Two fields returned in the API plugins endpoint 'name' and
    'index' have been removed.
fixes:
  - The API plugins API endpoint is returning outdated,
    duplicated and incomplete information. The hat-trick
    of uselessness. This fix will correct that. The duplicated
    field ('name') has been removed. The outdated field has been
    renamed (from 'index' to 'alias-search'). The missing field
    has been added ('alias-listener').
