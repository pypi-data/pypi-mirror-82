    Config options for searchlight-api and searchlight-listener
    are grouped under config groups [api] and [listener].
upgrade:
  - Options 'bind_host', 'bind_port', 'backlog', 'tcp_keepidle', 'ca_file',
    'cert_file', 'key_file', 'workers', 'max_header_line', 'public_endpoint',
    and 'http_keepalive' are moved to [api] group.
    Options 'listener_workers' is renamed to 'workers' and moved to [listener]
    group.
    Options 'host' and 'http_timeout' are removed since they are not
    currently used anywhere.
fixes:
  - The workers for listener was always 1, so config listener_workers
    was not work as expected. Now operators can set 'workers' under group
    [listener] to running multiple listener processes.
