bifrost-prep-for-install
========================

This role performs the initial file downloads to allow a user to install
bifrost.  It does not require internet access, as new URLs or local
filesystem clones of repositories can be defined.

Requirements
------------

This role requires:

- Ansible 1.9

Internet access was originally a requirement for installation, however access
is no longer required.  See doc/source/offline-install.rst for details on
installing without it.

Role Variables
--------------

git_root: The base location for cloned git repositories.  This defaults to
          "/opt/stack".

ironicclient_git_url: URL for ironicclient, defaults to:
                      https://opendev.org/openstack/python-ironicclient

openstacksdk_git_url: URL for openstacksdk, defaults to:
                      https://opendev.org/openstack/openstacksdk

shade_git_url: URL for shade, defaults to:
               https://opendev.org/openstack/shade

ironic_git_url: URL for ironic, defaults to:
                https://opendev.org/openstack/ironic

ironicclient_git_folder: The folder to clone ironicclient to if missing,
                         defaults to: "{{ git_root}}/ironicclient.git"

ironic_git_folder: The folder to clone ironic to if missing, default to:
                   "{{ git_root}}/ironic.git"

openstacksdk_git_folder: The folder to clone openstacksdk to if missing,
                         defaults to: "{{ git_root}}/openstacksdk.git"

shade_git_folder: The folder to clone shade to if missing, defaults to:
                  "{{ git_root}}/shade.git"

ironicclient_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

ironic_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

openstacksdk_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

shade_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

dib_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "master".

ironicinspector_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

ironicinspectorclient_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to
                                  "stable/stein".

reqs_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

staging_drivers_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

keystone_git_branch: Branch to install, defaults to "stable/stein".

copy_from_local_path: Boolean value, defaults to false. If set to true,
                      the role will attempt to perform a filesystem copy of
                      locally defined git repositories instead of cloning
                      the local repositories in order to preserve the
                      pre-existing repository state.  This is largely
                      something that is needed in CI testing if dependent
                      changes are pre-staged in the local repositories.

ci_testing_zuul: Boolean value, default false. This value is utilized
                 to tell the preparatory playbook when the prep role
                 is running in a CI system with Zuul, which in such
                 cases the repositories must be copied, not overwritten.
Dependencies
------------

None at this time.
