        ![Main-CI Workflow](https://github.com/Aquaveo/param_persist/workflows/Main-CI/badge.svg)
        
        This library will be used to persist param instance to databases, files or other persistent stores.
        
        The current supported persist methods are:
        
        - sqlalchemy database
        
        This library so far requires the dev version of param. That can be installed by running the following:
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install git+https://github.com/holoviz/param.git
        ```
        
        An jupyter notebook example of how to use the library can be found in the `examples` folder.
