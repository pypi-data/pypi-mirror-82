    The Senlin-Engine was responsible for a large number of threaded
    tasks. To help lower the number of potential threads per process and to
    make the Engine more resilient, starting with OpenStack Ussuri, the Engine
    service has been split into three services, ``senlin-conductor``,
    ``senlin-engine`` and ``senlin-health-manager``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Two new services has been introduced that will need to be started
    after the upgrade, ``senlin-conductor`` and ``senlin-health-manager``.

    With the introduction of these new services new configuration options
    were added to allow operators to change the number of proceses to spawn.
