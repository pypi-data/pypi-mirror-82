features:
  - |
    Admin role users can now access and modify all resources (clusters, nodes,
    etc) regardless of which project that belong to.
security:
  - |
    Removed the restriction for admin role users that prevented access/changes
    to resources (clusters, nodes, etc) belonging to projects not matching the
    project used for authentication.  Access for non-admin users is still
    isolated to their project used for authentication.
