        =======
        
        ``gsheetsplus`` is an extension over the ``gsheets`` library to provide added functionalities like plotting graphs between two axis.
        
        ``gsheets`` is a small wrapper around the [Google Sheets API]( https://developers.google.com/sheets/) (v4) to provide
        more convenient access to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) from Python scripts.
        
        [Turn on the API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/quickstart/python#step_1_turn_on_the_api_name), download an OAuth client ID as JSON file, and create a
        ``Sheets`` object from it. Use its index access (``__getitem__``) to retrieve
        SpreadSheet objects by their id, or use ``.get()`` with a sheet URL.
        Iterate over the ``Sheets`` object for all spreadsheets, or fetch spreadsheets
        by title with the ``.find()`` and ``.findall()`` methods.
        
        SpreadSheet objects are collections of WorkSheets, which provide access to the
        cell values via spreadsheet coordinates/slices (e.g. ``ws['A1']``) and
        zero-based cell position (e.g. ``ws.at(0, 1)``).
