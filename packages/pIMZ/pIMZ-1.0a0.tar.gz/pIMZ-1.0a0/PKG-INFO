        ## Description
        
        pIMZ is a framework for Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data analysis.
        The python implementation is available from  [github.com/mjoppich/pIMZ](http://github.com/mjoppich/pIMZ).
        For installation follow the instructions given here.
        
        pIMZ focuses on a differential setting, where masses, specific to certain areas are first determined, and then serve as input for a cell-type detection framework and/or a differential expression setting.
        
        pIMZ's documentation is available here: [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pimz/badge/?version=latest)](https://pimz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) .
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install most Python packages is via ``pip``.
        
        If not already done, you must first install the following dependencies manually. This is because at the time of writing this document, dabest requires ``pandas~=0.25``, which is incompatible with probably the rest of the world nowadays. So first dabest is installed, then numpy and pandas are upgraded again ::
        
            sudo pip3 install dabest
            sudo pip3 install numpy pandas --upgrade
        
        Only then we should install ``pIMZ`` ::
            sudo pip3 install pIMZ
        
        ``pIMZ`` is now ready to go!
        
        ## Usage
        
        References to examples and example notebooks can be found in the ``examples`` folder, or in the [documentation](https://pimz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
        
        All available classes and their functions are explained in the [modules/API documentation](https://pimz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html).
