Firmware Manager API
********************
**Module:** ``typhoon.api.firmware_manager``

The Firmware Manager API provides functions to update and change firmware configurations using python.

.. note::
    Care must be taken to guarantee that power is not removed from the HIL while firmware update is on course,
    especially considering that firmware update can occur in an automated test run without being noticed.
