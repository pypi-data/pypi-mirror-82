Description: 
        # swipe
        
        Swipe through data once, with a comb that will pick up the points you're looking for.
        
        Think single pass search.
        
        Think k nearest neighbors, but brute force, but with multiple targets.
        
        # Example
        
        ```pydocstring
        >>> import swipe
        >>> swipe.highest_score_swipe([5,3,7,2,9,7], k=2)
        [(7, 7), (9, 9)]
        >>> swipe.highest_score_swipe(iter([5,3,7,2,9,7]), score_of=lambda x: x % 3, k=2)
        [(2, 2), (2, 5)]
        ```
        
        That, but multidimensional and meant to be used with big data iterators.
