        ## Installation
        
        This package requires Python 3.6+ and pip 20+, and recommends using the Python
        3.8 runtime. To install, run 
        
        ```
        pip install asfpy-aridyckovsky
        ```
        
        ## Usage 
        
        Current usage requires importing the namespace directly:
        
        ```
        from asfpy import asfpy
        ```
        
        This can then be used to work with internal methods. For instance:
        
        ```
        asfpy.allocate(applicants, editors)
        ```
        
        will run the allocation algorithm, which returns a list of matchings between
        applicants and two editors each. If two editors cannot be matched, the
        applicant remains in an unmatched list.

        ### Packaging
        
        Install via pip: `setuptools`, `wheel` and `twine`. Update version number in
        `setup.py` before creating a new distribution.
        
        From root of project, run `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` to create
        distribution in `dist/*`. Then run `twine upload dist/*`.
