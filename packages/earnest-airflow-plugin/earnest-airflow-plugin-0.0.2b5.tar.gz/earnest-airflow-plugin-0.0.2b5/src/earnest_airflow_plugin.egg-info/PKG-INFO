        Operators and Hooks for Airflow
        
        ## Airflow at Earnest
        
        We use heavily the `KubernetesPodOperator` for the following reasons:
        
        - Keep non-scheduling logic out of the scheduler.
        - Avoid locking logic inside Airflow (containers can run through other schedulers).
        - Avoid accumulating python dependencies in the Airflow image.
        - Align with our engineering culture (functional programming and strongly typed languages lead to more maintainable code, Haskell preferred :) ).
        
        As such, you will find most of the Operators we share inherit from the `KubernetesPodOperator`.
        
        ## Running the tests locally
        
        0. Install dev requirements
        
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
            ```
        
        1. Run the unit tests
        
            ```bash
            pytest -v -m "not kubernetes"
            ```
        
        2. Start a local kubernetes cluster through [docker-for-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Mac/Windows) or [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) (Linux)
        
        3. Bootstrap the cluster (it'll use the `airflow` namespace)
        
            ```bash
            tests/resources/kubernetes/bootstrap.sh
            ```
        
        4. Run the kubernetes tests
        
            ```bash
            AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES__IN_CLUSTER=False pytest -v -m "kubernetes"
            ```
        
        ## Releasing
        
        Currently, publishing a new version of the project is a manual process:
        
        0. Install dev requirements
        
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
            ```
        
        1. Edit the `version` in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg)
        
        2. Create a new git release:
        
            ```bash
            # e.g.
            git tag -a v0.0.1
            ```
        
            There's a simple template in [RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md](RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md) for a release message.
        
        3. Push the release:
        
            ```bash
            git push origin v0.0.1
            ```
        
        4. Create a source distribution:
        
            ```bash
            python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            ```
        
        5. Upload to PyPi
        
            ```bash
            twine upload dist/*
            ```
