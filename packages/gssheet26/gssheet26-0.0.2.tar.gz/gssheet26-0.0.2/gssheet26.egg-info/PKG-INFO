        # Library Used
        
        I have used the [gspread](https://pypi.org/project/gspread/) and [oauth2client](https://pypi.org/project/oauth2client/) service to authorize and make API calls to Google Cloud Services.

        # LET'S GET STARTED
        
        # How to Install
        
        ```python
         pip install gssheet26
        ```
        
        The name of this package is "gssheet26" and you can use this package to read the data from [GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format and then using [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) you can manipulate the data in table using [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) 
        
        ## Function to read the data
        
        To read the data from google spreadsheet you have to use `getdata(jsfile, gsfile)` function and inside the function you have to give the path of your [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file and the name of your [GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).
        For example:- I want to read the data from [Greendeck](https://www.greendeck.co/) Assignment file. So Here How it should be written.
        
        ``` Python
        getdata("your_JSON_Path", "Greendeck Assignment")
        ```
