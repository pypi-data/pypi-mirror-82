Update to v0.8.5

Description:
------------

In this update I have added a task to compute momentum distributions using `qdtk_analysis.x` and added a plotting script.
A lot of dependencies have been updated and the code has been reformatted using `black`.

- 7b4ce63: Update tqdm requirement from 4.46.1 to 4.47.0
- 9d05320: Add two scripts to recalculate pickle files in simulations/scans and update the doit state database. This can be necessary if the pickle protocol is changed in the library or if the pickle output for something (e.g. numpy arrays) changes (maybe due to a change in the underlying library).
