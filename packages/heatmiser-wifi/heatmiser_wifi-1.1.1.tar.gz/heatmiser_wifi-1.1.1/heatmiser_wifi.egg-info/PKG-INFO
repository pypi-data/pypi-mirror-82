Description: # Heatmiser WiFi - python library and tool
        [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/midstar/heatmiser_wifi?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/midstar/heatmiser_wifi)
        
        ## Overview
        A [Heatmiser](http://www.heatmiser.com/) WiFi Thermostat communication tool and library for python.
        
        Supported Heatmiser Thermostats are DT, DT-E, PRT and PRT-E.
        
        The main class of the library is Heatmiser. It supports retrieval of all Thermostat parameters as a dictionary. It also supports setting of some (but not all) of the Thermostat parameters. 
        
        ## Supported platforms
        The application is written in Python and has been successfully tested with Python version 2.7 and 3.4.
        
        Both Windows and Linux has been tested successfully. Mac OS X has not been tested, but should work as well.
        
        ## Installation
        Run 
        
            python -m pip install heatmiser_wifi
        
        This will install both the library and the command line tool.
        
        Alternatively, since this is just one python file, you can download heatmiser_wifi.py and include it in your project.
          
        ### Using libary
        
        See how the library/class is used in the main() function of heatmiser_wifi.py.
        
        ### Using command line tool
        
        To list all parameters write:
        
            heatmiser_wifi -c <pincode> <themostat_ip_address> -l 
        
        It is also possible to read and write specific parameters. For instructions, write:
        
            heatmiser_wifi -h
