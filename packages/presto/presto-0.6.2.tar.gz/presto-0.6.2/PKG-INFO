Description: pRESTO - The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit
        ================================================================================
        
        pRESTO is a toolkit for processing raw reads from high-throughput sequencing of
        B cell and T cell repertoires.
        
        Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable
        large-scale characterization of lymphocyte repertoires, defined as the
        collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of
        B cells and T cells. The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) is composed of a
        suite of utilities to handle all stages of sequence processing prior to germline
        segment assignment. pRESTO is designed to handle either single reads or
        paired-end reads. It includes features for quality control, primer masking,
        annotation of reads with sequence embedded barcodes, generation of
        unique molecular identifier (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of paired-end 
        reads and identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous options for sequence 
        sorting, sampling and conversion operations are also included.
