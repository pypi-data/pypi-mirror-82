PPM(Prediction by partial matching) is a compression algorithm which has several variations of implementations.
PPMd is the implementation by Dmitry Shkarin. It is used in the RAR by default and by 7-Zip as one of several possible methods.

ppmd, aka. ppmd-cffi, is a python bindings with PPMd implementation by C language.
Core codes are derived from p7zip, portable 7-zip implementation, and now only consist of Ppmd7, PPMd ver.H.

Since 7-zip uses PPMd ver.H and RAR uses PPMd ver.I, the ppmd-cffi is considered compatible with 7-zip's implementation. 

Installation
============

As usual, you can install ppmd-cffi using python standard pip command.
CAUTION: Since it is a bindings with C source code, C compiler should be installed on your operating system.

```
pip install ppmd-cffi
```

All C source codes are bundled with ppmd-cffi package.

Usage
