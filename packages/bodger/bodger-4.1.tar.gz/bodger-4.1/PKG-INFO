        BODGER
        ======
        
        The bodger tool is a very simple wrapper that reads a config, matches grainss,
        and determines what command to run, and runs it. This makes it easy to set
        what commands to run for test, build, docs etc in a CI/CD pipeline. You can
        kind of think of it like a platform specific Make command with a better config.
        
        Config
        ======
        
        The default config is "bodger.conf" and should be located inside of the root of
        a project.
        
        This config looks like this::
        
            bodger:
              test:
                kernel:Linux: pytest
              pkg:
                os:Arch: tiamat -c build.conf --pkg-tgt Arch
                os_family:RedHat: tiamat -c build.conf --pkg-tgt rhel7
              bin:
                kernel:Linux: tiamat -c build.conf
        
        Then the system can by run by calling bodger <cmd>::
        
            bodger test
            bodger pkg
            bodger bin
