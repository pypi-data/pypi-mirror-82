    Configuration option `legacy_kafka_client_enabled` added to allow working
    with both legacy *kafka-python* and new *Confluent Kafka* client. Setting
    this to *true* enables *kafka-python* client which is default. Please set
    message format version for the Kafka brokers to 0.9.0.0 to avoid
    performance issues until all consumers are upgraded.
