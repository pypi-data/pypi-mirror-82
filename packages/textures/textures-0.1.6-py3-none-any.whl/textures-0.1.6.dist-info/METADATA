Textures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Textures is a python package that allows you to extract some handy features and stats from text columns in Pandas DataFrames.
It also includes some useful functions for cleaning text and extracting patterns (e.g., hashtags and emails from strings) and save your time looking for regular expression patterns on google and stackoverflow

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The package has three modules:

`features`: has a `extract_features` which allow you to compute and return more than 30 features from a Pandas DataFrame.

`clean_text`: provides several functions for cleaning string inputs (e.g., remove hashtags).

`find`: provides several functions for finding patterns such as hashtags in string inputs.
