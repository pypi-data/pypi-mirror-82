guide you through the process.

Binary install on Windows
-------------------------

does not require Python installation is to install ged2doc as a separate
Windows application which includes all necessary components. Download an
installer (EXE file) from 
`latest release <https://github.com/andy-z/ged2doc/releases/latest>`_
(or any specific release) and execute it on your computer. After installation
Program Menu and Desktop will show a ``ged2doc`` shortcut which starts a
command prompt with access to ``ged2doc`` command line application.
