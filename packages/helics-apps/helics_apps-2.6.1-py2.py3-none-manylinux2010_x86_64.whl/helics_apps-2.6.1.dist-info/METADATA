# HELICS Apps 
[HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS) is a cross-platform co-simulation framework that enables multiple
simulation tools to exchange data and stay synchronized in time to create larger simulations. This is a set of
binary wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux for installing the collection of HELICS apps utilities. If you want
the Python interface for writing HELICS programs in Python, see the [helics](https://pypi.org/project/helics/)
pip package.

## Installation
At minimum for the Linux binary wheels to work properly, [pip 19.0 is required](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#manylinux-compatibility-support).
Regardless of your platform, you should probably upgrade pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade` to make
sure the right binary package is found. If you aren't on a supported platform, you will need to compile
the HELICS apps from source or check if your system package manager has a copy of them.

After upgrading pip, running `python -m pip install helics` should fetch a binary wheel if one is available for your platform.

### Binary distributions
This package provides pre-compiled binary wheels for the following operating systems

* Linux 64-bit (manylinux2010 compatible -- glibc 2.12+, most popular distributions released since May 2010)
* macOS (10.9+) 64-bit
* Windows 32/64-bit

### Source distributions
Unfortunately, there is no source distribution for this package at this time since that requires compiling HELICS from source.

## Release
HELICS is distributed under the terms of the BSD-3 clause license. All new
contributions must be made under this license. [LICENSE](LICENSE)
