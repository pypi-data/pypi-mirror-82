# Event ID 4723: An attempt was made to change an account's password

## Description

This event generates every time a user attempts to change his or her password.

* For user accounts, this event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations.
* For domain accounts, a Failure event generates if new password fails to meet the password policy.
* For local accounts, a Failure event generates if new password fails to meet the password policy or old password is wrong.

For domain accounts if old password was wrong, then “4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed” or “4776: The computer attempted to validate the credentials for an account” will be generated on domain controller if specific subcategories were enabled on it.

Typically you will see 4723 events with the same Subject\Security ID and Target Account\Security ID fields, which is normal behavior.
