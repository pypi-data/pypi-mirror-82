    """ Base class for creating a Spinner.

    Spinners are a way to convey that work is being done through a looping
    sequence of characters.

    To get the Spinner string, simply get the string representation of an
    instance of this class.

    By default, the Spinner iterates through the character sequence '-', '\\\\',
    '|', and '/', before it loops back to the beginning.

    The user can specify a custom sequence by calling `set_stages(stage_tuple)`,
    and providing the stages in the function parameter.

    To change the stage the Spinner is on, either call
    `set_current_stage(stage_index)` or `next()`.

    Spinners can be given a prefix or suffix, which will be displayed to the
    immediate left or right of the Spinner, respectively.

    The prefix and suffix may contain replacement fields that can automatically
    be filled with information relevant to the Spinner. There are four
    predefined replacement fields that can be used:
        1) `percent` - Insert the percent (i.e. current_value / max_value) the Spinner has been filled.
        2) `current_value` - Insert the current value of the Spinner.
        3) `max_value` - Insert the maximum value of the progress bar.
        4) `remaining` - Insert the amount of progress remaining (i.e. max_value - current_value)

    The user can also define any custom replacement fields in either of these
    areas, as well as optionally providing the mapping to evaluate and replace
    them. These mappings are called the prefix_replacement_fields for the prefix
    and suffix_replacement_fields for the suffix.

    Unlike the default behavior of `string.format()`, if the user includes
    replacement fields in any of these strings that do not have values mapped
    for replacement, no error will be thrown. Instead, the replacement fields
    will remain in the string, untouched, so taht the user may replace them at
    a later time.
