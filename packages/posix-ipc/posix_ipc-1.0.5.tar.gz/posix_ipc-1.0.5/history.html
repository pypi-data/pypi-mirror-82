<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>This is the version history for the
<a href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/posix_ipc/">posix_ipc
module</a>.</p>

<p>As of version 1.0.0, I consider this module complete. I will continue to
suppport it and look for useful features to add, but right now I don't see any.
</p>

<ul id="history">

    <li><strong><span id="current">Current</span> &ndash; 1.0.5 (10 October 2020) &ndash;</strong>
    	<p><strong>This is the last version that will support Python 2.7.</strong></p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Added a <code>fileno</code> method to <code>SharedMemory</code> and
        		<code>MessageQueue</code> objects to support Python's <code>selectors</code>
        		standard library module.
        	</li>
        	<li>Added a demo (in the demo5 directory) demonstrating use of <code>selectors</code>.
        		<i>Mange tak</i> to Henrik Enggaard for the <code>fileno()</code> suggestion
        		and for contributing the demo.
        	</li>
        	<li>Added automatic Travis testing on GitHub for Python 3.7 thanks to Ben Harper,
        		and for Python 2.7 under macOS.
        	</li>
        	<li>Fixed a <a href='https://github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc/issues/22'>deprecation warning
        	under Python 3.9</a>. <i>Merci</i> to sbraz for the bug report.
        	</li>
        	<li>Updated HTML documentation (including this file) to HTML 5.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>1.0.4 (13 Feb 2018) &ndash;
        <ul>
        	<li>Fixed bug where the <code>SharedMemory</code> and <code>Semaphore</code> classes
        		<a href='https://github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc/issues/2'>didn't behave correctly</a> when assigned a file descriptor of 0. Thanks to
        		Thomas Troeger for the bug report.
        	</li>
        	<li>Fixed a small but <a href='https://github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc/issues/3'>significant documentation bug</a> which stated that the <code>size</code> param was ignored when opening
        		an existing <code>SharedMemory</code> segment. Thanks to Thomas Troeger, again.
        	</li>
        	<li>Fixed a compilation failure under Python 3 when the internal use <code>POSIX_IPC_DEBUG</code>
        		flag was on. Děkuji to Tomáš Zahradnický for the bug report.
        	</li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>1.0.3 (10 Jan 2018) &ndash;
    	<p>A <i>mea culpa</i> release to clean up some accumulated technical debt.</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>Moved repository to git and GitHub.</li>
        	<li>Changed link options in the build script for the first demo that caused a build fail on some (all?) Linuxes.</li>
            <li>Fix a few bugs where functions that were documented to accept keyword arguments only accepted them as positional arguments; added tests to exercise keyword arguments.</li>
        	<li>Removed dependency on <code>setuptools</code> from <code>setup.py</code>.</li>
            <li>Added code to semaphore tests to avoid triggering a bug on older FreeBSDs (and perhaps other BSDs).</li>
            <li>PEP8 improvements.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>1.0.2 (10 Jan 2018) &ndash;
    	<p>This version was also skipped due to a release error. Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>1.0.1 (10 Jan 2018) &ndash;
    	<p>This version was skipped due to a release error. Those responsible have been sacked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>1.0.0 (11 Mar 2015) &ndash;
        <ul>
        	<li>Added ability to pass names as unicode in Python 2.</li>
        	<li>Added ability to pass names as bytes in Python 3.</li>
        	<li>Dropped support for Python &lt; 2.7.</li>
            <li>Made unit tests nicer by taking advantage of Python 2.7+
            certainty and removed some code that only supported Python 2.6.
            </li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.9 (14 Nov 2014) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Added the ability to build on platforms that don't support the
            POSIX Realtime Signals Extension. ありがとう to Takashi Yamamoto for
            the patch.
            </li>
            <li>Added extensive unit tests.</li>
            <li>Minor documentation updates.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.8 (20 Feb 2014) &ndash;
    	<p>As with 0.9.7, there are no code or feature changes in this version.
    	This version merely corrects a documentation error.
    	</p>

    	<p>This version comes with a big wish for peace in Ukraine. Мир!</p>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.7 (20 Feb 2014) &ndash;
    	<p>There are no code or feature changes in this version. The bump in
    	    version number reflects that this is the first version
    	    also available on PyPI.
    	</p>

    	<p>This version comes with a big wish for peace in Ukraine. Мир!</p>
	</li>

    <li>0.9.6 (23 Oct 2013) &ndash;

    	<p>Fixed two BSD-specific bugs introduced in version 0.9.5
    		that occurred if the kernel module <code>mqueuefs</code> wasn't
    		loaded at install time. Specifically --
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The installer
            would print a harmless but distracting error message from sysctl.
            (This also affected OS X which is FreeBSD-ish.)
            </li>

            <li><code>posix_ipc</code> would build with an inappropriate
            value for <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</code>.
            Subsequent attempts to create a message queue would fail unless the
            caller set the <code>max_messages</code> param to an appropriate
            value. (This didn't affect OS X since OS X doesn't support message
            queues at all.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, rewrote the message queue thread notification code to address
        the old bug (<code>Fatal Python error: PyEval_AcquireLock: current thread state is NULL</code>)
        that appeared during release testing for 0.9.5 and which
        has plagued me on and off since I wrote this code. The new code uses
        <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/init.html#non-python-created-threads">the
        algorithm recommended in the Python documentation</a> which may have
        been flaky when I started using it in Python 2.4. It seems stable now
        under Python 2.6+/3.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.5 (14 Oct 2013) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Added the ability to use Semaphores in context managers.
        	Thanks to Matt Ruffalo for the suggestion and patch.
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a big under FreeBSD 9.x where I used overly ambitious
            values for some message queue constants at build time. Now,
            <code>posix_ipc</code> asks <code>sysctl</code> for the correct values.
            <i>Köszönöm</i> to Attila Nagy for the bug report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.4 (2 Sept 2012) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a buglet. When creating shared memory under Linux and
        specifying both a size and the read-only flag, creating the memory
        would succeed but calling <code>ftruncate()</code> would fail.
        The failure to change the size was correctly reported
        but <code>posix_ipc</code> failed to clean up the shared memory segment
        it had created. That's now fixed. Thanks to Kevin Miles for the bug
        report.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.3 (2 Jan 2012) &ndash;
        <p>Added a bugfix/feature to raise an error (rather than segault)
            when trying to use a closed semaphore.
            Thanks to Russel for the suggestion and patch.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.9.2 (6 Nov 2011) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where timeouts in <code>Semaphore.acquire()</code>,
                <code>MessageQueue.send()</code> and <code>MessageQueue.receive()</code>
                were only accurate to about one second due to use of the C call
                <code>time()</code>. Switching to <code>gettimeofday()</code> fixes
                the problem. Thanks to Douglas Young for the bug report and
                patch.
            </li>

            <li>Fixed a bug in <code>prober.py</code> that caused install to fail
                under Ubuntu 11.10. <code>prober.py</code> specified link options
                in the wrong order, and so linking one of the test
                applications that's built during setup was failing. Thanks
                to Kevin Miles for the bug report.
            </li>

            <li>Added a check in <code>prober.py</code> to see if
                <code>sysconf_names</code> exists in the <code>os</code> module. It
                doesn't exist under Cygwin, and this code caused an error
                on that platform. Thanks to Rizwan Raza for the bug report.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.9.1 (7 Apr 2011) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed (?) a bug in message queue thread notification that caused
                <code>ceval: tstate mix-up</code> and other fun messages. Thanks to
                Lev Maximov for the bug report.
            </li>

            <li>Added the <code>demo3</code> directory with demos of message queue.
                This was supposed be included in version 0.9.0 but I accidentally
                left it out. (Also reported by Lev.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.9.0 (31 Dec 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Added the <code>demo3</code> directory with demos of message queue
            notification techniques. Also, fixed two bugs related to message
            queue notification. Big thanks to
            Philip D. Bober for debugging and providing a patch to the
            most difficult part of the code. The bugs were &ndash;
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First, the series of calls to set up the Python thread in
               <code>process_notification()</code> were simply wrong. They worked
               some (most?) of the time but would segfault eventually because
               I was creating a Python thread state when I should not have.
            </li>

            <li>Second, the code in <code>process_notification()</code> failed
                to consider that the user's callback might re-request
                notification, thus overwriting pointers that I would later
                decref. <code>process_notification()</code> is now thread-safe.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>


    <li>0.8.1 (15 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a sloppy declaration that caused a compile error under
            Cygwin 1.7.1. Thanks to Jill McCutcheon for the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>


    <li>0.8.0 (2 Mar 2010) &ndash;
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed message queue support detection in FreeBSD and
                the platform-specific documentation about FreeBSD.
            </li>

            <li>Rearranged the documentation and split the history
                (which you're reading now) into a separate file.
            </li>

            <li>I fixed two small bugs related to the confusing
                message queue constants. The bugs and associated changes are
                explained below. The explanation is really long not
                because the changes were big (they weren't), but because
                they and rationale behind them are subtle.

                <p>Fixing these bugs was made easier by this realization:
                    on all of the systems to which I have access that implement
                    message queues (FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, Linux, and Windows +
                    Cygwin), all except Linux implement them as
                    memory-mapped files or something similar. On these
                    non-Linux systems, the
                    maximum queue message count and size are pretty darn big
                    (<code>LONG_MAX</code>). Therefore, only on Linux is anyone likely to
                    encounter limits to message queue size and content.
                </p>

                <p>The first bug I fixed was related to four message queue
                    constants mentioned in <code>posix_ipc</code> documentation:
                    <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</code>,
                    <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</code>,
                    <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</code> and
                    <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</code>. All four were defined
                     in the <code>C</code>
                    code, but the two <code>XXX_DEFAULT</code> constants weren't exposed on
                    the Python side.
                </p>

                <p>The second bug was that under Linux, <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</code> and
                    <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</code> were permanently fixed to their
                    values at <code>posix_ipc</code>'s compile/install time even if the
                    relevant system values changed later. Thanks to Kyle Tippetts
                    for bringing this to my attention.
                </p>

                <p><code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</code> was arbitrarily limited to
                    (at most) 1024. This wasn't a bug, just a bad choice.
                </p>

                <p>I made a few changes in order to fix these problems &ndash;</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The constants <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX</code> and
                        <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX</code>
                        <strong>have been deleted</strong> since they were only sure to
                        be accurate on systems where they were irrelevant. Furthermore,
                        Linux (the only place where they matter) exposes these values
                        through the file system (in
                        <code>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</code> and
                        <code>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</code> respectively) so Python
                        apps that need them can read them without any help
                        from <code>posix_ipc</code>.
                    </li>

                    <li><code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</code> and
                        <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</code> are now exposed to
                        Python as they should have been all along.
                        <code>QUEUE_MESSAGES_MAX_DEFAULT</code> is now set to
                        <code>LONG_MAX</code> on all platforms except Linux, where
                        it's set at compile time from <code>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</code> remains at the fairly
                        arbitrary value of 8k. It's not a good idea to make it too big
                        since a buffer of this size is allocated every time
                        <code>MessageQueue.receive()</code> is called. Under Linux, I
                        check the contents of <code>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max</code>
                        and make <code>QUEUE_MESSAGE_SIZE_MAX_DEFAULT</code> smaller if
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.7.0 (21 Feb 2010) &ndash;
        <p>Added Python 3.1 support.</p>
    </li>

    <li>0.6.3 (15 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where creating an IPC object with invalid
                parameters would correctly raise a <code>ValueError</code>, but
                with a message that may or may not have correctly identified
                the cause. (My code was making an educated guess that was
                sometimes wrong.)

                <p>As of this version, if initialization of an IPC object
                    fails with the error code <code>EINVAL</code>,
                    <code>posix_ipc</code> raises a <code>ValueError</code>
                    with the vague-but-correct message "Invalid parameter(s)".
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Cleaned up the code a little internally.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.6.2 (30 Dec 2009) &ndash;
        <p>Fixed a bug where a <code>MessageQueue</code>'s <code>mode</code>
            attribute returned garbage. <i>Grazie</i> to Stefano Debenedetti for
            the bug report.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>0.6.1 (29 Nov 2009) &ndash;
        <p>There were no functional changes to the module in this version, but
        I added the convenience function <code>close_fd()</code> and fixed
        some docmentation and demo bugs/sloppiness.
        </p>
    	<ul>
            <li>Added the convenience function <code>SharedMemory.close_fd()</code>.
                Thanks to Kyle Tippetts for pointing out the usefulness
                of this.
            </li>
            <li>Added the module attributes <code>__version__</code>,
                <code>__copyright__</code>, <code>__author__</code> and
                <code>__license__</code>.
            </li>
    	    <li>Fixed the license info embedded in <code>posix_ipc_module.c</code>
    	        which was still referring to GPL.
            <li>Replaced <code>file()</code> in <code>setup.py</code> with
                <code>open()</code>/<code>close()</code>.</li>

            <li>Demo changes &ndash;
                <ul>
                    <li>Made the demo a bit faster, especially for large
                        shared memory chunks. Thanks to Andrew Trevorrow
                        for the suggestion and patch.
                    </li>

    <li>0.6 (5 Oct 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Relicensed from the GPL to a BSD license to celebrate the
    	        one year anniversary of this module.
            <li>Updated Cygwin info.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.5.5 (17 Sept 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Set <code>MQ_MAX_MESSAGES</code> and <code>MQ_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE</code> to
    	        <code>LONG_MAX</code> under cygwin.
    	        (<i>Danke</i> to René Liebscher.)
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Surrounded the <code>#define PAGE_SIZE</code> in probe_results.h with

    	    <li>Fixed a bug where
    	        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/ada39e984dfc3da6/fd6becbdce91a6be?#fd6becbdce91a6be">Python
    	        would generate an uncatchable
    	        KeyboardInterrupt when Ctrl-C was hit during a wait</a>
    	        (e.g. <code>sem.acquire()</code>).

    	        <p>Thanks to Maciek W. for reporting the problem and to
    	            Piet van Oostrum and Greg for help with a solution.
    	        </p>
            </li>
            <li>Minor documentation changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.5.3 (8 Mar 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added automatic generation of names.</li>
    	    <li>Changed status to beta.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.5.2 (12 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed a memory leak in <code>MessageQueue.receive()</code>.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug where the name of the <code>MessageQueue</code>
    	        <code>current_messages</code> attribute didn't match the name
    	        given in the documentation.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added the VERSION attribute to the module.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed a documentation bug that said message queue
    	        notifications were not yet supported.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.5.1 (8 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed outdated info in setup.py that was showing up
    	        in the Python package index. Updated README while I
    	        was at it.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.5 (8 Feb 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added the message queue notification feature.</li>
    	    <li>Added a <code>mode</code> attribute to each type.</li>
    	    <li>Added <code>str()</code> and <code>repr()</code> support to
    	        each object.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added a demo for message queues.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed some minor documentation problems and added
    	        some information (esp. about Windows + Cygwin).
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.4 (9 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Added message queue support.</li>
    	    <li>Fixed the poor choices I'd made for names for classes and
    	        errors by removing the leading "Posix" and "PosixIpc".
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Simplified the prober and expanded it (for message
    	        queue support).
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Cleaned up this documentation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.3.2 (4 Jan 2009) &ndash;
    	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed an uninitialized value passed to PyMem_Free() when
    	        invalid params were passed to either constructor.
    	    </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.3.1 (1 Jan 2009) &ndash;
     	<ul>
    	    <li>Fixed a big bug where the custom exceptions defined by this
    	        module weren't visible.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a compile complaint about the redefinition of
    	        <code>SEM_VALUE_MAX</code> on Linux (Ubuntu) that I introduced
    	        in the previous version.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Fixed a bug in the demo program premise.c where I wasn't
    	        closing the file descriptor associated with the shared
    	        memory.
    	    </li>
    	    <li>Added the <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> attribute. This was already
    	        available in the mmap module that you need to use shared
    	        memory anyway, but adding it makes the interface more
    	        consistent with the <code>sysv_ipc</code> module.
    	    </li>
    	</ul>
    </li>

    <li>0.3 (19 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Added informative custom errors instead of raising
        	    OSError when something goes wrong.
        	</li>

        	<li>Made the code friendly to multi-threaded applications.
        	</li>

			<li>Added the constants <code>O_CREX</code> and
			    <code>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</code>.
			</li>

			<li>Added code to prohibit negative timeout values.</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.2 (4 Dec 2008) &ndash;
    	<ul>
        	<li>Removed the un-Pythonic <code>try_acquire()</code> method. The
        	    same functionality is now available by passing a timeout of
        	    <code>0</code> to the <code>.acquire()</code> method.
        	</li>

			<li>Renamed the module constant <code>ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</code> to
			    <code>SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</code>.
			</li>

			<li>Moved the demo code into its own directory and added C
			    versions of the Python scripts. The parameters are now in a
			    text file shared by the Python and C program, so you can
			    run the C version of Mrs. Premise and have it communicate with
			    the Python version of Mrs. Conclusion and vice versa.
			</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>0.1 (9 Oct 2008) &ndash; Original (alpha) version.</li>
</ul>
