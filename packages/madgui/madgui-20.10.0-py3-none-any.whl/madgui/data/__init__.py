"""
Pure data package. Contains data files for:

- config
- units
- icons
- license

and more to come if necessary.

Note that if there is a definitive correspondence between data file and module
or package, the data should be kept and named along with their corresponding
module. For example: keep .ui files along with the module that implements the
widget logic.
