Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
and "help wanted" is open for your work.
Initiative bug fixes are also :ref:`highly welcome! <welcome-contributing>`

Implement features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

wBuild could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official wBuild docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Request/propose a feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/gagneurlab/wBuild/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Working with wBuild code
------------------------

Prepare
~~~~~~~

Please make sure you've read the user :ref:`overview <user-overview>` to understand the basics of wBuild -
:ref:`wBuild position in the Snakemake workflow <overview-of-functionality>`, :ref:`demo project <running-demo>` as well as
:ref:`features list <features>` could be especially interesting here.

Setting up the development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `wbuild` for local development.

1. Fork the `wbuild` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/wbuild.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv wbuild
    $ cd wbuild/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 wbuild tests
    $ python setup.py test or py.test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

If the pull request adds functionality, we kindly ask you to also update the docs, telling about this new cool stuff!
Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add this feature to the list in README.rst.
