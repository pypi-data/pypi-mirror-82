# Regulatory Documentation Manager

## Quick Start

```
pip install rdm
rdm init
cd regulatory
make
# regulatory documents stored in the "release" directory
```

## Introduction

Our Regulatory Documentation Manager (RDM) is a set of templates and python scripts for generating regulatory documents for software that is a, or is embedded in, medical devices.

*RDM is especially well-suited for early-stage software-only medical devices.*

To use RDM, one needs to know how to use Markdown and Git. For this reason, as projects and teams grow, and as people who are unfamiliar with these tools join the team, you may want to migrate some or all of the your documents to another format (e.g., Microsoft Word). RDM provides a simple mechanism for doing this when the time comes. Typically, documents which are only touched by developers will remain in RDM, but many other documents will be converted to Word Files and stored in a separate Document Management System.

## Our Philosophy on Regulations

Engineering is about optimizing. To do it one must first know what is being optimized.

Some students go to school because they need the degree to get a job.  These students optimize their actions to get the best grades for the least amount of work.

The best students go to school to learn, and while they often try to get good grades, they optimize their actions so as to learn as much as they can.

Likewise, some companies follow regulations to get certified to sell their products.  They optimize everything they do to get past the regulators for the lowest cost.

The best companies follow the regulations with a degree of faith that these regulations will make their products better and safer.

## Typical Workflow

RDM is designed to be used within a typical software development workflow.  When a new project is started, developers

1. Install RDM using `pip install rdm`
2. Generate a set of documents, which are stored in the git repository, using `rdm init`
3. Edit configuration variables in the generated files
4. Write _software requirements_ in a YAML file, also stored in the git repository
5. Generate a top-level architecture document, also stored in the repository, which may subdivide the project into smaller _software items_
6. Tickets (e.g. GitHub Issues) are labeled with one or more requirement ids
7. Each commit messages must include a reference to the ticket that is being worked on
8. Pull requests must be reviewed, and certain standardized comments are placed in reviews to confirm validation
9. Write new architecture documents as new _software items_ are implemented
10. Once a new _release_ is cut, generate a set of IEC62304 documents using `rdm release`
11. Run `rdm gap [some checklist] release/*.md` to check for missing items
12. These markdown files can then be converted to PDFs or Word documents using a tool such as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)

## Our Design Goals for RDM

1. Provide an simple mechanism to migrate away from RDM to more complex tools.
2. Provide a set of template regulatory documents that covers common use-cases.
3. Focus on software developers ease-of-use; the plan documents are intended to read and used frequently by the software developers on the team.  Thus, wherever there was a tradeoff between making it easy to read for developers vs regulators/auditors, we optimized for developers.  For example, we re-order IEC62304 sections to follow a more logical order for developers at the cost of being less parallel to IEC62304's structure.
4. Easy auditablility.  In order to make it easier for regulators/auditors to read the document, we include auditor comments and links back to IEC62304.  These links and notes are hidden by default, but there is a flag that enables turning them on.  This way, we can use the "official" version without comments during our day-to-day work, but we can give the auditors two copiesâ€”both the "official" version and the "auditor" version that has all these extra notes. The auditor notes make it easier to tweak the existing templates, since you will know whether a section of the template is required or not.
5. Provide readable documents; e.g., other 62304 templates include many short deeply nested sub-sections.  We use a maximum of two levels of nesting.  We also provide flags (e.g., for different safety classes) that prune out irrelevant parts of the document, so that the documents only include what is necessary for the particular project.
6. Provide beautiful documents.  We believe making beautiful looking documents will encourage people to read and update them.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.5+
- Make
- Jinja2 2.7+
- PyYAML
- gitpython
- jsonschema
- pygithub (optional, required when using GitHub as your project manager)
- Pandoc and Latex (optional, required for PDF generation)
- Reportlab and Svglib (optional, required to include SVGs in PDFs)

## Installation

`pip install rdm`

or, if you need svg and github support:

`pip install rdm[svg,github]`

## User Guide

Run `rdm init` to generate a set of base documents for a project.  By default these documents are placed in the current working directory in a new directory named `regulatory`, including:

- A `Makefile` for compiling documents.
- A `config.yml` file for configuring RDM.
- Regulatory document templates are in the `documents` directory.
- Data used for generating templates is stored in YAML files within the `data` directory.
- Images are stored in the `images` directory
- Temporarily generated files are stored in `tmp`.
- The final compiled release documents are stored in the `release` directory.

## Document Formats

Release documents are produced in two different formats:

1. [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with standardized YAML front matter
2. PDFs

Typically, the current markdown version of the relevant documents are stored in the git repository, so that they can be easily browsed and linked to by developers.

Compile the release markdown documents by running `make`.

The PDF versions are generated for submission to regulatory bodies or for upload to other document control systems.

Compile the release PDF documents by running `make pdfs`.

## Templating and Data Files

The markdown files support basic templating using the [Jinja templating language](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/latest/templates/). Data loaded from yaml files in the `data` directory are provided for context while rendering.

We make a few modifications to the default Jinja templating.

### First Pass Output

We add `first_pass_output` to the rendering context, which is useful when you need to inspect the rendered document to generate, e.g., definition lists. This object has two useful properties:

- `first_pass_output.source` contains the complete output of a first pass generation of the document.
- `first_pass_output.lines` contains the same output as list of lines.

### Extensions

We also support [extensions](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/extensions/). Extensions are set using the `md_extensions` configuration paramater in `config.yml`. See the Markdown Extensions section for details about available markdown extensions.

## YAML Front Matter

The Markdown document format contains YAML front matter, which is used to generate the title page, headers, and footers in the associated PDFs.

For example, your markdown YAML front matter may be:

```
---
id: PLAN-001
revision: 1
title: Software Plan
---
```

The required `title` value is used for the document title page and in the header.

The required `id` value is the document id. This is show in the title page and in the header.

The optional `revision` value is printed on the title page and in the header, if present. Revisions are not typically required for records.

The manufacturer name, which must be specified in `system.yml` data document, is also show on the title page.

## Images

Both the markdown and PDFs support images.

Images in the markdown documents the path the images will usually look like:

```
![image label](../images/my-image.svg)
```

We suggest using SVGs because they are resolution independent.  SVGs are converted to PDFs to be included in the latex (and then PDF) version of the documents.

Images must be able to fit within a single page of a PDF document for the formatting to look normal.

Note that svglib has several limitations.  As of April 2018, these include:

- style sheets are not supported (only the style attribute)
- clipping is limited to single paths, no mask support
- color gradients are not supported
- transparency is not supported

Also note that markdown does not support having spaces in links, thus image names can not have spaces.

By default, images are stretched to full page width.

## Project Management Backends

The FDA, and other regulatory bodies, require records to prove that you are following your development process. Typically, the data needed to produce these records is captured in one more software development project management tools. We often use GitHub or Jira. When putting together a 510(k) or other regulatory documentation, it is helpful to have a mechanism for moving this data into an appropriate document format.

RDM assists in this process by providing project management backends. These backends can be customized and configured in `config.yml`. Essentially, they pull data from a project management tool and dump it into a YAML file with a standardized format. The YAML file can then be used, like any other data file, to render templates.

## Markdown Extensions

### Auditor Notes Extension

We have added some features to make it more convenient to include regulatory auditor notes.  Auditor notes are references to ISO standards and regulations, which are convenient for auditors as well as people who are adapting templates for their own needs (the notes will tell you which parts of the template are required).

Auditor notes are specified with double square brackets:

```html
Some specification [[62304:6.2.4]].
```

Auditor notes are included in the default templates, but are stripped out by the `rdm.md_extensions.AuditNoteExclusionExtension` extension. They can be retained by enabling the `rdm.md_extensions.AuditNoteInclusionExtension` extension instead.

### Section Numbers Extension

The `SectionNumberExtension` will automatically add section numbering. This will convert section number markdown like

```html
## Some Topic
```

to

```
## 2.1 Some Topic
```

### Vocabulary Extension

The `VocabularyExtension` extends `first_pass_output` to include a dictionary of words found in the trial first pass. The set of words can then be accessed as a jinja variable using `{{ first_pass_output.words }}`. More convenient is testing whether a particular word is in the document:

```html
{% if first_pass_output.has('foobot') %}
*foobot*: Automated process that implements foo.
{% endif %}
```

The above definition of the example word `foobot` would only be included if the full document actually uses the word. Case insensitive versions of `words` and `has` are available as `words_ignore_case` and `has_ignore_case`.

## Audit Checklists

We include several checklists for various standards. 
These are used by the `rdm gap` command to check output documents for appropriate references to a given standard. 

For example ISO62304 requires that the device be classified according to the hazard levels 
it could present.
This requirement occurs in section 4.3.a of the standard.
All of the 62304 checklists will include the following:
```
62304:4.3.a Software safety classification: system class
```
The gap analysis will report whether the keyword `62304:4.3.a` appears in the documents. 
Hopefully it does appear and it appears at the location where the hazard classification is
described and justified. The tool only reports whether it is present or missing.
The additional text `Software safety classification: system class` is not used by the tool.
It is a mnemonic to help you locate or remember where in the standard you should be looking.

You can create your own new or modified checklists.
The checklists are read line by line using a very simple format:

1. Except for comments and includes, the first non-white space word is treated as an expected keyword.
2. The keyword includes all text up to either a space character or the end of the line.
3. The descriptive text following a keyword is included in the output report whenever the
keyword is missing.
4. Leading white space is ignored.
5. If the first non-white space is a '#' then the line is a comment and is ignored.
6. If the first non-white space is the word 'include' then the following text is another checklist
to be applied.
7. If an include file name matches a builtin checklist, then that builtin is used 
(For example `include 14971_2007`).
8. If the file name does not match a built in checklist then it is treated as a file reference 
relative to the current checklist location (For example `include ./my_special_checklist.txt`).
9. Blank lines are ignored.

We recommend making a master checklist using `include` lines in your master checklist
to reference the various standards you intend to meet.
For example if you have a class B device and want to meet the latest ISO 62304 standard
as well as ISO 13485:2016 then you could use the following master checklist:
```
include 62304_2006_AMD1_class_b
include 13485_2016
```
To see a list of all the built in checklists:
```
rdm gap --list
```

To use a checklist against some source files:
```
rdm gap some_checklist some_source.md another_source.md ...
```

To see the full content of a checklist, simply leave off the source files:
```
rdm gap some_checklist
```

If you want to make a modified copy of a built in checklist direct the output of the above into a file.
The format will be correct for a checklist which you can then edit to meet your specific needs:
```
rdm gap some_checklist > my_custom_checklist.txt
```

## RDM's Limitations

- The default templates were written with small software teams in mind (e.g., 2 - 5 developers).
- Only supports GitHub as your project manager (we plan on adding support for Gitlab, Jira, Trello, and Pivotal over time)
- Assumes that the risk management process is stored elsewhere (we plan on adding support for ISO14971's risk management process soon)
- Only supports a single _software system_
- Only support using git as your version control system
- Assumes the whole software system is in a single git repository
- Default templates assume the whole software system has a single safety classification

## Future Work

- Add support for more project management backends, such as Gitlab, Jira, Trello, Pivotal, and others.
- Add templates for the usability standard ISO62366
- Provide templates for a basic quality management systems that fulfill ISO13485
- Provide templates for 510(k) submissions
- Continue to streamline the workflow
- Provide more thorough examples

## Who Uses RDM?

- We use it at [Innolitics](https://innolitics).
- A couple of our clients have used it and have successfully submitted 510(k)s using documents produced by it. One client also passed an IEC62304 [Intertek](https://www.intertek.com) Audit using the documents produced by RDM.

**If you use RDM, please let us know.**
