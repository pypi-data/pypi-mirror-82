# What is the IEC62304 safety classification of the entire system?
# "A" - No injury or damage to health is possible
# "B" - Non-serious injury is possible
# "C" - Death or serious injury is possible
safety_class: C

# What is the FDA's software Level of Concern?
# "Minor" - Failures or latent design flaws are unlikely to cause any injury to
#    the patient or operator.
# "Moderate" - A failure or latent design flaw could directly
#    result in minor in jury to the patient or operator.  The level of concern
#    is also Moderate if a failure or latent flaw could indirectly result in
#    minor injury to the patient or operator through incorrect or delayed
#    information or through the action of a care provider.
# "Major" - A failure or latent flaw could directly result in
#    death or serious in jury to the patient or operator. The level of concern
#    is also Major if a failure or latent flaw could indirectly result in death
#    or serious injury of the patient or operator through incorrect or delayed
#    information or through the action of a care provider.
