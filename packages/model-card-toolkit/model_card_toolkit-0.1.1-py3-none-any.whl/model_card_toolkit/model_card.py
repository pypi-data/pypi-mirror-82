"""Model Card Data Class.

The Model Card (MC) is the document designed for transparent reporting of AI
model provenance, usage, and ethics-informed evaluation. The model card can be
presented by different formats (e.g. HTML, PDF, Markdown). The properties of
the Model Card (MC) are defined by a json schema. The ModelCard class in the
ModelCardsToolkit serves as an API to read and write MC properties by the users.
