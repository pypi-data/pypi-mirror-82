        `Mirror` is an open source python application for mirror site (e.g. [mirror.bjtu.edu.cn](https://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn)) to sync files from upstreams (it uses [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) internally), it actually works like a [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), but still has some differences. It has been served for mirror.bjtu.edu.cn with more than 40 rsync [tasks](https://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn).

        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        ## Install from PyPI
        
        You can install `mirror` by running pip:
        
        ```bash
        $ sudo pip install mirror
        ```
        
        ## Install from source
        
        Or if you want to build and install from source:
        
        ```bash
        $ python setup.py build
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Config and running
        
        After that, you are going to set up environment, you are encouraged to add a specific user to run `mirrord`, here we suppose the username is `mirror` and its home directory is `/home/mirror`.
        
        Make necessary directories:
        
        ```bash
        $ sudo chown mirror:mirror /var/log/mirrord /var/log/rsync
        $ sudo mkdir /etc/mirror
        $ sudo cp config/mirror.ini /etc/mirror/
        ```
        
        Now you can edit mirror.ini to fit your needs and run:
        ```bash
        $ mirrord
        ```
        and that's done. Also you can use `man mirrord` or `mirrord -h` to read the documents.
        
        If `mirrord` is running, you can run:
        ```bash
        $ mirrord -t
        ```
        to show the current task queue.
