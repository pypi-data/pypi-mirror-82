# Mirror

[![Build Status]][Github Actions] [![Python version]][PyPI] [![Release version]][Release url] [![PyPi version]][PyPI] [![AUR version]][AUR]

`Mirror` is an open source python application for mirror site (e.g. [mirror.bjtu.edu.cn](https://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn)) to sync files from upstreams (it uses [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) internally), it actually works like a [cron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), but still has some differences. It has been served for mirror.bjtu.edu.cn with more than 40 rsync [tasks](https://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn).

You are welcome to send comments, patches and any others to [github](https://github.com/ideal/mirror/issues) or to [@idealities](http://twitter.com/idealities).

Installation Instructions
=========================

## Install from PyPI

You can install `mirror` by running pip:

```bash
$ sudo pip install mirror
```

## Install from source

Or if you want to build and install from source:

```bash
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

## Config and running

After that, you are going to set up environment, you are encouraged to add a specific user to run `mirrord`, here we suppose the username is `mirror` and its home directory is `/home/mirror`.

Make necessary directories:

```bash
$ sudo chown mirror:mirror /var/log/mirrord /var/log/rsync
$ sudo mkdir /etc/mirror
$ sudo cp config/mirror.ini /etc/mirror/
```

Now you can edit mirror.ini to fit your needs and run:
```bash
$ mirrord
```
and that's done. Also you can use `man mirrord` or `mirrord -h` to read the documents.

If `mirrord` is running, you can run:
```bash
$ mirrord -t
```
to show the current task queue.
