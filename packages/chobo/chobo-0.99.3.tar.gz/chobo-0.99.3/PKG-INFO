Description: # chobo
        
        The chobo module is a forked version of the [intrographics](http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/intrographics/) module developed by [Dr. Lisa Torrey](http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/).
        
        It allows you to create graphical displays in your Python 3 programs.
        The name chobo (ì´ˆë³´) is a Korean word that means a beginner/novice, and the name is to inspire beginners at programming to give it a try.
        
        It is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), and uses the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) module as the back-end, and adds the following features:
        
        * Image files other than just GIF
        * Arc as a new shape
        * An empty image shape
        * Shape rotations
        * Use of any system fonts
        * Sound/music files and their playback
