        Introduction
        ============

        EEA Geotags features:
        
        1. User friendly search for locations
        2. Map preview of selected locations
        3. Suggest geographic entities based on http://geonames.org

        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get eea.geotags support in Plone 4 using this
        package is to work with installations based on `zc.buildout`_.
        Other types of installations should also be possible, but might turn out
        to be somewhat tricky.
        
        To get started you will simply need to add the package to your "eggs" and
        "zcml" sections, run buildout, restart your Plone instance and install the
        "eea.geotags" package using the quick-installer or via the "Add-on
        Products" section in "Site Setup".
        
        .. _`zc.buildout`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/
        
        You can download a sample buildout at:
