        Install as a user
        =================
        To use screen19, you need to have a Python environment containing DIALS_.
        Instructions for installing DIALS can be found here_.
        You can then install screen19 with::
        
            libtbx.pip install screen19
        
        Install as a developer
        ======================
        If you want to develop screen19 then check out a local copy of the repository and install it with::
        
            git clone git@github.com:xia2/screen19.git
            libtbx.pip install -e screen19
        
        You then need to rebuild libtbx to get the screen19 dispatcher.

        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - Some overly verbose log messages from the French-Wilson calculation are now suppressed by default.
          You can still see them, if you want to, by running screen19 in debug mode with::
        
              screen19 verbosity=1 <other arguments>

        Features
        --------
        
        - screen19 now supports DIALS 3 and DIALS 2.2.
        
          `DIALS is available here <https://dials.github.io/installation.html>`_.
        
          * DIALS 3 is the latest major release and is actively supported.  It is currently Python 3.6 only.
          * DIALS 2.2 is a long-term support release.  It only receives bug fixes and support will be withdrawn at the end of 2020.  It supports Python 2.7 and 3.6.
          * DIALS 1.14 is no longer under active development and screen19 support for it has been withdrawn. (#25)
        
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - Perform French-Wilson scaling on the integrated intensities before performing the Wilson plot analysis.
          This fixes screen19 failures for certain cases where the data consist of few reflections. (#29)
