        **pyexcel-libxlsxw** is a tiny wrapper library to write data in xlsx and xlsm format
        using libxlsxwriter. You are likely to use it with `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`__.

        You can install pyexcel-libxlsxw via pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install pyexcel-libxlsxw

            $ python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        ================================================================================
        
        As a standalone library
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Write to an xlsx file
        ********************************************************************************
        
        
        
        Here's the sample code to write a dictionary to an xlsx file:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from pyexcel_libxlsxw import save_data
            >>> data = OrderedDict() # from collections import OrderedDict
            >>> data.update({"Sheet 1": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]})
            >>> data.update({"Sheet 2": [["row 1", "row 2", "row 3"]]})
            >>> save_data("your_file.xlsx", data)
        
        
        
        Here's the sample code to help you read the data back. You will need to install pyexcel-xls or pyexcel-xlsx.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from pyexcel_io import get_data
            >>> data = get_data("your_file.xlsx")
            >>> import json
            >>> print(json.dumps(data))
            {"Sheet 1": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "Sheet 2": [["row 1", "row 2", "row 3"]]}
        
        
        Write an xlsx to memory
        ********************************************************************************
        
        Here's the sample code to write a dictionary to an xlsx file:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from pyexcel_libxlsxw import save_data
            >>> data = OrderedDict()
            >>> data.update({"Sheet 1": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]})
            >>> data.update({"Sheet 2": [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]})
            >>> io = StringIO()
            >>> save_data(io, data)
            >>> # do something with the io
            >>> # In reality, you might give it to your http response
            >>> # object for downloading
        
        
        
        
        
        Here's the sample code to help you read the data back. You will need to install pyexcel-xls or pyexcel-xlsx.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> # This is just an illustration
            >>> # In reality, you might deal with xlsx file upload
            >>> # where you will read from requests.FILES['YOUR_XLSX_FILE']
            >>> data = get_data(io, 'xlsx')
            >>> print(json.dumps(data))
            {"Sheet 1": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "Sheet 2": [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]}
        
        
        
        As a pyexcel plugin
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        No longer, explicit import is needed since pyexcel version 0.2.2. Instead,
        this library is auto-loaded. So if you want to read data in xlsx format,
        installing it is enough.
        
        
        Let's assume we have data as the following.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> import pyexcel as pe
            >>> sheet = pe.get_book(file_name="your_file.xlsx")
            >>> sheet
            Sheet 1:
            +---+---+---+
            | 1 | 2 | 3 |
            +---+---+---+
            | 4 | 5 | 6 |
            +---+---+---+
            Sheet 2:
            +-------+-------+-------+
            | row 1 | row 2 | row 3 |
            +-------+-------+-------+
        
        
        Writing to an xlsx file
        ********************************************************************************
        
        Here is the sample code:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> sheet.save_as("another_file.xlsx")

        Developer guide
        ==================
        
        Development steps for code changes
        
        #. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-libxlsxw.git
        #. cd pyexcel-libxlsxw
        
        Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:
        
        #. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
        
        Then install relevant development requirements:
        
        #. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
        #. pip install -r requirements.txt
        #. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
        
        Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
        and update CHANGELOG.rst.
        
        .. note::
        
            As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
            library is not released. Once the dependecy is installed
            (will be released), the future
            version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.
        
        
        How to test your contribution
        ------------------------------
        
        Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is adviable that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development releases.
        
        On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::
        
            $ make
        
        On Windows systems, please issue this command::
        
            > test.bat
        
        
        Before you commit
        ------------------------------
        
        Please run::
        
            $ make format
        
        so as to beautify your code otherwise travis-ci may fail your unit test.
