# A flag (or option) can be driven by the existence of a file (i.e. a file
# flag). When an instance operates with file flags, two modes are approached in
# this implementation. Either the state of file flags are unknown and are
# attempted to be read. Once read, the instance can handle their process
# accordingly based off these flag states. The other path is if there is a
# request to configure file flags. If a file flag is being configured, the
# intent would be to configure the one (or multiple) file flag state and have
# the running instance shutdown.
