    extend a partially filtered environment (globals) for a run_path event

    When invoking ``run_path`` [1], a dictionary of globals is provided to
    pre-populate a script's globals before execution. Inside the releng process,
    the command ``run_path`` is invoked several times to help load settings and
    package-specific scripts. To exist in sharing releng-provided constants and
    also assisting in allow some-level of sharing user-defined constants, the
    list of globals to be populated can be extended each execution and be passed
    into a following script. Not all global options are desired to be passed.
    For example, Python magic options and referenced built-in functions. This
    method can be used to easily extend an existing dictionary of globals while
    also filtering out undesired entries output from external scripts.

    helper to easily configure an environment variable

    Provides a caller an simple method to configure an environment variable for
    the current context. This call is the same as if one directly added a
    key-value into ``os.environ``.

    An example when using in the context of script helpers is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        releng_env('KEY', 'VALUE')

    Args:
        key: the environment key to set the value on
        value: the environment value to set

    os.environ[key] = value
