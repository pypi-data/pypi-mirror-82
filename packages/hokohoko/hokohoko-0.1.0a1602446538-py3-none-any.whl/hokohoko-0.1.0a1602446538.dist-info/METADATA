# Hokohoko

_Hokohoko means "to trade, barter, exchange, sell, buy, export, alternate" in
Te Reo Māori._[1]

Hokohoko aims to provide a consistent benchmark for academics and others who
wish to test the efficacy of their algorithms on FOREX speculation.
It provides 7 years of per-minute market data across 50 currency pairs, and
various assessors by which researchers may verify the accuracy of their algorithm.
