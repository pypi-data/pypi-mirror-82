# Sonora

Sonora is a Python-first implementation of gRPC-Web built on top of standard Python APIs like WSGI and ASGI for easy integration.

## Why?

Regular gRPC has a lot going for it but is awkward to use in some environments. gRPC-Web makes it easy to get gRPC working in
environments that need HTTP/1.1 but the Google gRPC and gRPC-Web implementations don't like to coexist with your normal Python
frameworks like Django or Flask. Sonora doesn't care what ioloop you use, this means you can run it along side any other Python
web framework in the same application!

This makes it easy to

- Add gRPC to an existing code base.
- Run gRPC behind AWS and other HTTP/1.1 load balancers.
- Integrate with other ASGI frameworks like Channels, Starlette, Quart etc.
- Integrate with other WSGI frameworks like Flask, Django etc.

The name Sonora was inspired by the [Sonoran gopher snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituophis_catenifer_affinis).

## How?

Sonora is designed to require minimal changes to an existing Python application.

### Server

#### WSGI

Normally a WSGI application ([such as your favourite Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/)) will have a file somewhere named `wsgi.py`
that gets your application setup and ready for your web server of choice.

```python
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```

in it somewhere so that your application server (uWSGI, Gunicorn etc) knows where your code is.

To add Sonora's gRPC-Web capabilities to an application like the above all you need to do to enable it is this.

```python
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from sonora.wsgi import grpcWSGI
import helloworld_pb2_grpc

# Setup your frameworks default WSGI app.

application = get_wsgi_application()

# Install the Sonora grpcWSGI middleware so we can handle requests to gRPC's paths.

application = grpcWSGI(application)

# Attach your gRPC server implementation.

helloworld_pb2_grpc.add_GreeterServicer_to_server(Greeter(), application)
```

And now you have a combined HTTP/1.1 Django + gRPC application all under a single port.

#### ASGI

For ASGI things are mostly the same, the example shown here integrates with [Quart](https://github.com/pgjones/quart) but it's more or less the same for other frameworks.

```python
from sonora.asgi import grpcASGI
from quart import Quart
import helloworld_pb2_grpc

# Setup your frameworks default ASGI app.

application = Quart(__name__)

# Install the Sonora grpcASGI middleware so we can handle requests to gRPC's paths.

application = grpcASGI(application)

# Attach your gRPC server implementation.

helloworld_pb2_grpc.add_GreeterServicer_to_server(Greeter(), application)
```

And now you have a combined HTTP/1.1 Quart + gRPC application all under a single port.

### Clients

Sonora currently only provides a sync API implementation based on requests.

#### Requests (Sync)

Instead of using gRPCs native `grpc.insecure_channel` API we have `sonora.client.insecure_web_channel` instead which provides a [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) powered client channel to a gRPC-Web server. e.g.

```python
    import sonora.client

    with sonora.client.insecure_web_channel(
        f"http://localhost:8080"
    ) as channel:
        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        print(stub.SayHello("world"))
```

#### Aiohttp (Async)

Instead of `grpc.aio.insecure_channel` we have `sonora.aio.insecure_web_channel` which provides an [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) based asyncio compatible client for gRPC-Web. e.g.

```python
    import sonora.aio

    async with sonora.aio.insecure_web_channel(
        f"http://localhost:8080"
    ) as channel:
        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        print(await stub.SayHello("world"))

        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        async for response in stub.SayHelloSlowly("world"):
            print(response)
```

This also supports the new streaming response API introduced by [gRFC L58](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/pull/155)

```python
    import sonora.aio

    async with sonora.aio.insecure_web_channel(
        f"http://localhost:8080"
    ) as channel:
        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        async with stub.SayHelloSlowly("world") as response:
            print(await response.read())
```
