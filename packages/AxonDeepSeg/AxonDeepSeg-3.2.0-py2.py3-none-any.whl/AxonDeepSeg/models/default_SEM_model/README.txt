Steps to train this model
=========================

1. Get ADS version: [b05a40a] https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/commit/b05a40aa03979a83313fe8704ee389672ed26ed7 
2. Get the data: https://osf.io/vrdpe/?action=download&version=1
3. Run the notebook "guide_dataset_building.ipynb" to perform a split into training and validation set. 
4. Go to "training_guideline.ipynb" notebook and make necessary changes required in paths, URLâ€™s and config. Finally run all the cells of the notebook.
5. After successfully running all the cells, the trained model file will be saved under the directory: AxonDeepSeg/axondeepseg/models/

Upload on OSF
=============
Add this README.txt file along with the model and zip the folder. 
Model is saved in OSF under the models/ directory. Example:
