    This `change <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/661851/>`__ allowed Qinling
    API to be used with Apache ``mod_wsgi`` and uWSGI.

    Using Apache/uWSGI is the best approach for a production environment, Apache
    virtualhost and uWSGI examples are available into ``etc/{apache2|uwsgi}`` directory.

    See `Qinling documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/qinling/latest/contributor/mod-wsgi.html>`__
    for details.
