    When using Kubernetes as the orchestrator, Qinling will create Kubernetes
    pods to run executions of functions. In Kubernetes, pods are non-isolated
    unless the NetworkPolicy is configured and enforced. In Qinling, we create
    NetworkPolicy to disable the communication between pods and the traffic
    from outside the cluster.
upgrade:
  - Re-apply the Kubernetes manifest file to grant NetworkPolicy resource
    operation permission to ``qinling`` user in Kubernetes,
    ``curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/qinling/master/example/kubernetes/k8s_qinling_role.yaml | kubectl apply -f -``
