    Docker support has been added to help people to test Qinling
    easily and quickly. Authentication has been disabled by default
    which means Keystone is not required.

    Dockerfile has been created to build Docker image from the master branch.
    Docker compose files have been created to deploy RabbitMQ, MySQL and
    Qinling API/Engine containers.

    Files have been added under ``tools/docker/`` directory same as for the
    README with all the required instructions.
