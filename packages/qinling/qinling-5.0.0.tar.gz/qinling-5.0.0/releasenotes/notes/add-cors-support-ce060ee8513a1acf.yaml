    Add ``CORS``, ``HTTPProxyToWSGI`` and ``WSGI`` support based on
    ``oslo_middleware`` library in front of the Qinling API.

    The purpose of this middleware is to set up the request URL correctly
    in the case there is a proxy (for instance, a loadbalancer such as
    HAProxy) in front of the Qinling API.

    The ``HTTPProxyToWSGI`` option is ``off`` by default and needs to be
    enabled via a configuration value.
