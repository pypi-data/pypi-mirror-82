           Qinling (is pronounced "tchinling") refers to Qinling Mountains in southern
           Shaanxi Province in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between
           North and South China and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some
           of which is found nowhere else on Earth.
        
        Qinling is Function as a Service for OpenStack. This project aims to provide a
        platform to support serverless functions (like AWS Lambda). Qinling supports
        different container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes/Swarm, etc.) and
        different function package storage backends (local/Swift/S3) by nature using
        plugin mechanism.
