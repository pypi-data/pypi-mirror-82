    Introduce a fixed network mode for environments. Specifically,
    when this mode is activated, in the environment creation dialog
    user is no longer prompted for a network and instead a network
    previously assigned to the current project is used.

    Network is assigned to project using project metadata key (custom) with network ID as the value.
    Specify this metadata key in Horizon config to be able to use it

    This behavior is disabled by default and could be enabled by adding:

    USE_FIXED_NETWORK = yes
    FIXED_MURANO_NETWORK = murano_network

    to the Horizon configuration.
