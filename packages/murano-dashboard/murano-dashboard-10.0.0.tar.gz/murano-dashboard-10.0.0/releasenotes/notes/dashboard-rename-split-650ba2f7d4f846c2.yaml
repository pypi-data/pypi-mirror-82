    Murano Dashboard has been renamed to App Catalog and now allows
    seamless integration and single panel structure
    with App Catalog UI dashboard.
features:
  - Murano dashboard has been renamed to App Catalog,
    monolithic config file has been split into multiple small files.
    Every such file defines either a panel group or adds
    general murano-related settings to horizon.
upgrade:
  - To upgrade to Newton version of app catalog you need to remove old
    ``_50_murano.py`` config file, that defined in murano dashboard. Be sure to
    also remove any .pyc and .po files. After that you need to copy all new
    config files from ``muranodashboard/local/enabled/*.py`` to
    ``openstack_dashboard/local/enabled/`` and restart horizon
