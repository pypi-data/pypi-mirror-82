    If a UI definition of the murano-applications has regex validation
    for input field then before generating html an additional attribute
    called 'data-validations' will be added to the form. This attribute
    has an array of objects. These objects have regex patterns and error
    messages. When filling a Murano-Applications form input fields will be
    validated by js script.
