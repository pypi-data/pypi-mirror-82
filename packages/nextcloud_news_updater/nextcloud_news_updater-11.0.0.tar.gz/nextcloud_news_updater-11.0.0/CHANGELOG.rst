9.0.0
+++++

**Breaking Changes**

* Require Python 3.4 or greater
* Config files are now validated. Unknown config keys will throw an error and abort the updater
* The **--testrun** command line argument was removed in order to officially support starting the updater using your cron. Use **--mode singlerun** instead

**Bugfixes**

- Fix bug that would exit update in singlerun mode when an error occurred during update
- Fix bug that would not run the after cleanup command in cli mode and would therefore never remove old articles

**Improvements**

* Added a **--mode** parameter which allows you to run the updater using a cron. You have to ensure that only one instance run at a time however (e.g. using SystemD timers)
* Added automated tests which cover the full functionality
