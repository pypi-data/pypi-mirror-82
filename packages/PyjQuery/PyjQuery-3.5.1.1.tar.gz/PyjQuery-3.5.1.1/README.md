## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

## A Brief Look

### Import
```python
import jquery
from dicksonui import Application, window

app = Application() # make Application

jquery.install(app) # install jquery

mywindow = window() # make window

app.add(mywindow) # add window to app

# $ is invalid name for python so S used
S=jquery.jQuery(mywindow) # add jquery to window

mywindow.show() # show window

# think S as $ n jquery
```

### DOM Traversal and Manipulation

Get the  `<button>`  element with the class 'continue' and change its HTML to 'Next Step...'

```python
S( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )
```

### Event Handling

Show the  `#banner-message`  element that is hidden with  `display:none`  in its CSS when any button in  `#button-container`  is clicked.
```python
from dicksonui.builtins import setCall, function
hiddenBox = S( "#banner-message" )

S( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function("event")  (

 setCall(hiddenBox.show)

))
```
### Ajax

Call a local script on the server  `/api/getWeather`  with the query parameter  `zipcode=97201`  and replace the element  `#weather-temp`'s html with the returned text.
```python
from dicksonui.builtins import setCall, function, code
S.ajax({
    
     "url": "/api/getWeather",
    
     "data": {
    
     "zipcode": 97201
    
     },
    
     success: function( "result" ) (
    
     setCall(S( "#weather-temp" ).html)(
     
             code('"<strong>" + result + "</strong> degrees"')
        )
         
      )
    
    });
```
