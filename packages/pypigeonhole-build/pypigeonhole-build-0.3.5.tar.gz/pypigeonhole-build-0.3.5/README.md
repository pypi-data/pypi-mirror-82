**Linux version of shell scripts is not working yet.**

This is a Python SDLC tool to shorten the time we spend on SDLC without
sacrificing quality. It does so by hard-coding certain flexible parts. 
Flexibility could lead to confusion and low efficiency because there is
no standard and thus we cannot build tools on top of that to improve
efficiency. 

Specifically, we tackle the following areas:
- dependency management: create central structure and populate information to 
  setup.py and requirements.txt/environment.yml.
- version management: tag GIT code with the current version and then bump the 
  version (save back to GIT too).
- identify the key steps in terms of scripts. These scripts' functionalities 
  are important abstractions. The implementation can be altered if needed,
  e.g., our unittest script is unittest based, you may have a pytest version.

A good example for efficiency is Java's mature tool, 
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).


## Goals

- set up a standard project structure. 
- create reusable tools to minimize the necessary work for dependency 
  management and CI. 
- Make routine steps efficient.
- Make out-of-routine steps not more painful, i.e., our code should not add 
  more hassle when you extend/modify it.
  
  
## Standard SDLC Process Acceleration

All scripts run in the project folder. Once Conda environment is created, 
run subsequent scripts in the environment as well (activate the environment).

- environment setup: ```pph_dev_env_setup.bat```

  In order to run this script, you need to 
  install this lib first. The scripts are installed in the <env>/Scripts.
  Running this in a new window is preferred. During our testing, we found that
  sometimes, conda env is corrupted after conda-build.
  >The existing conda environment with same env name will be deleted, and a 
  new environment will be created. 
  
  >requirements.txt and environment.yaml are generated as well. Whenever 
  we change dependencies, we need to rerun this script to re-generate the 
  files. Conda uses environment.yml, without "a" in yaml. However, Github 
  action uses environment.yaml, with "a" in yaml.

- **coding**: We hard code two filenames, 
  ```app_setup.py``` and ```dep_setup.py```
  under top package. These are used by the scripts(also used in setup.py). 
  The code in these 2 files are minimal in the sense:
    - the information is required, such as name and version.
    - they can be overwritten or extended.

- compile: This is out of scope due to varieties, C/C++, PyInstaller, Cython, 
  or no compiling at all, etc. 
  
- unit test: ```pph_unittest.bat``` 
  
  generate test coverage report and coverage badge.
  
  >In order to run test at the project root folder, we add a src reference in
  the __init__.py under test top package. Otherwise, tests can run only from
  the src folder.
  
- package: 
    - ```pph_package_pip.bat``` to pack Python libraries.
    - ```pph_package_conda.bat``` to pack both libraries and applications.
    - ```pph_pack_app_zip.bat``` to pack applications with binaries generated.
      Since this is a customized way, there is no associated upload tool and 
      users need to deal with uploading by themselves.
      
  The pip output folder is dist, the conda output folder is dist_conda, and 
  the zip output folder is dist_bin.
     
  Conda version is more flexible to customize because of the extra references 
  to meta.yaml and build scripts. Please check conda-build documents. 
  Furthermore, we use conda as the transport to deliver artifacts to target 
  machines/environments.  

- upload: 
    - ```pph_upload_pip.bat``` to upload library to the pip central server.
    - ```pph_upload_pip_test.bat``` to upload library to the pip test central 
      server.
    - ```pph_upload_conda.bat``` to upload library to the conda central server.
    
  We leave out the complexity of local artifact server setup. Variations are:
    - local pip/anaconda channels, for testing.
    - http tunnel through local channels.
    - local/internal pip/anaconda official servers through vendor support.
    - remote pip/anaconda official/central servers through internet.
    - 3rd party vendors, such as Artifactory servers.
    
  If you don't use central servers, it's likely you need to come up your own 
  versions.
    
- release: ```pph_release.bat``` 

  Tag the current version in GIT and then bump the current version 
  to the next. 
  >We use major.minor.patch format in versions. The minor and patch 
  increments are bounded by 100 by default. This can be overwritten in
  app_setup.py.

  >Check in changes first before running this script.

- install/deploy: 
    - lib installation: use pip and/or conda.
    - app deployment: conda can bundle scripts and Python code. So we use conda
      as the transport to deploy apps to conda environments. 
      >There are many other ways, ground or cloud, to deploy apps, such as 
      kubernetes, Ansible, etc. We leave these out due to high possible 
      customizations (i.e., no predictable patterns).


## Usage

Add this project as one of the dependencies. The installation installs the
reusable scripts to ```<env>\Scripts``` folder, in addition to the Python
code installed in ```<env>\Lib\site_packages\pypigeonhole_build```. 
The ```<env>\Scripts``` folder should be in PATH so that we can call them. 
The scripts assume we are in the project folder. 

Add dependencies in the dep_setup.py. Each dependency has the following fields:
- name: required. If name == python, the "python_requires" field in the 
  setup.py will be touched.
- version: default to latest. Need full format: '==2.5'
- scope: default to DEV, could be DEV/INSTALL. INSTALL dependencies show in the
  "install_requires" field. DEV dependencies show up in the "test_require" 
  field.
- installer: default to PIP, could be PIP/CONDA. Extendable to other 
  installers.
- url: this is for github+https.

If Conda is used, need to set the CONDA.env field, which is mapped to the first
line in the environment.yml. This is reusable unless you want to customize.

CONDA.channels can be alternated too (default to default, which can be omitted).

In app_setup.py, the only thing we need to change is the version value. Others
can stay the same or customize it, e.g., change version bump behavior to
bounded by 10.

Pip can be customized in setup.py, if needed. This file can be reused except
the import in most cases.

In summary, the information we need to code are minimal:
- dependencies in dep_setup.py
- version number in app_setup.py
- imports in setup.py to hook the above 2 files.

Now we could follow the previous SDLC steps.

For any runs, we use ```<script> 2>&1 | tee my.log``` to save the log to
local file, since some commands clear command window screen, and so we lose 
screen prints.

A sample project is in a separate repo: 
[Project Template](https://github.com/psilons/pypigeonhole-proj-tmplt).
In fact, we set up this project in the same way mentioned here too.

If these tools are not suitable, you just create other scripts local to the
project you work on. The existing scripts / Python code should not interfere
the overwritten/extension.


## Side Notes and Future improvements

- Sometimes, conda on windows is not stable due to locking. Rerun should work.
- package_data in setup.py is not supported (yet).
- dependency information is not populated to meta.yaml, used by conda-build.
- Need a network storage to store build/test results with http access for CI.
