Description: Local spelling
        ==============
        
        Developed by Fast Data Science, https://fastdatascience.com
        
        Source code at https://github.com/fastdatascience/localspelling
        
        Python library for localising spelling between British and American conventions, conserving case.
        
        Please note this library converts only spelling variants such as US "honour" vs UK "honor".
        
        It does not localise vocabulary such as "pavement" vs "sidewalk" or "aubergine" vs "eggplant".
        
        It also does not localise spellings where there is more than one correct conversion, such as US "program", which corresponds to both "programme" and "program" in British spelling.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Python 3.6 and above
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
          pip install localspelling
        
        Usage examples
        ==============
        
        Example 1
        
        .. code:: python
        
          from localspelling import convert_spelling
          convert_spelling("it has been an honor", "gb")
        
        outputs 'it has been an honour'
        
        Example 2: you can retrieve the dictionary used for the single words (this won't match wildcards like '-isation')
        
        .. code:: python
        
          from localspelling import get_dictionary
          get_dictionary("us")["honour"]
        
        outputs 'honor'
