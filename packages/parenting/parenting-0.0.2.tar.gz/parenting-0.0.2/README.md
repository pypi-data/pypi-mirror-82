I am a first time dad. I love it, though as beautiful and heartwarming it is, it is also challenging. Naturally, I tried to prepare the best I can. During my preparation, I quickly realized that my experience in software development is of little use to me. I was hoping for a more algorithmic approach to parenting. Obviously, this is nonesense to some extend, however, I found a book ``So beruhige ich mein Baby`` from Christine Rankl. I loved that book, cause it was providing very clear instructions, with some margin of error of course, nonetheless, it was helping me. As a developer, I translated those instructions and put them into a little advice giving Python package.
