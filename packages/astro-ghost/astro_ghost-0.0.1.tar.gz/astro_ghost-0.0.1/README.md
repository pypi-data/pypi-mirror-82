# GHOST
"At the last dim horizon, we search among ghostly errors of observations for landmarks that are scarcely more substantial. The search will continue. The urge is older than history. It is not satisfied and it will not be oppressed."
--Edwin Hubble

Welcome to GHOST, the database for supernovae and their host galaxies. This database contains ~16k sources in PS1, which were used to predict supernova classes in Gagliano et al. (2020). Installation instructions for the analysis tools are below. 

# Installation
The database can be found within this repository as GHOST.tar.gz. Helper functions can be found in ghostHelperFunctions.py for querying and getting quick stats about SN within the database, and tutorial_databaseSearch.py provides example usages. The software to associate these supernovae with host galaxies is also provided, and tutorial_hostAssociate.py provides examples for using this code.

# GHOST Viewer
In addition to these software tools, a website has been constructed for rapid viewing of many objects in this database. it is located at ghost.ncsa.illinois.edu.
