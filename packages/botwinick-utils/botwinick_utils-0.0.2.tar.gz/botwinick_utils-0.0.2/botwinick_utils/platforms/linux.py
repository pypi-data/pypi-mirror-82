# This module is used to fork the current process into a daemon.
# Almost none of this is necessary (or advisable) if your daemon
# is being started by inetd. In that case, stdin, stdout and stderr are
# all set up for you to refer to the network connection, and the fork()s
# and session manipulation should not be done (to avoid confusing inetd).
# Only the chdir() and umask() steps remain as useful.

    """
    This forks the current process into a daemon.

    The stdin, stdout, and stderr arguments are file names that will be opened and be used to replace
    the standard file descriptors in sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and sys.stderr.

    These arguments are optional and default to /dev/null. Note that stderr is opened unbuffered, so
    if it shares a file with stdout then interleaved output may not appear in the order that you expect.

    # Because you're not reaping your dead children, many of these resources are held open longer than they should.
    # Your second children are being properly handled by init(8) -- their parent is dead, so they are re-parented
    # to init(8), and init(8) will clean up after them (wait(2)) when they die.
    #
    # However, your program is responsible for cleaning up after the first set of children. C programs typically
    # install a signal(7) handler for SIGCHLD that calls wait(2) or waitpid(2) to reap the children's exit status
    # and thus remove its entries from the kernel's memory.
    #
    # But signal handling in a script is a bit annoying. If you can set the SIGCHLD signal disposition to SIG_IGN
    # explicitly, the kernel will know that you are not interested in the exit status and will reap the children
    # for you_.

# ## Why 2 forks?
# The first fork accomplishes two things - allow the shell to return, and allow you to do a setsid().
#
# The setsid() removes yourself from your controlling terminal.
# You see, before, you were still listed as a job of your previous process, and therefore the user might
# accidentally send you a signal. setsid() gives you a new session, and removes the existing controlling terminal.
#
# The problem is, you are now a session leader. As a session leader, if you open a file descriptor that is a terminal,
# it will become your controlling terminal (oops!). Therefore, the second fork makes you NOT be a session leader.
# Only session leaders can acquire a controlling terminal, so you can open up any file you wish without worrying
# that it will make you a controlling terminal.
#
# So - first fork - allow shell to return, and permit you to call setsid()
#
# Second fork - prevent you from accidentally reacquiring a controlling terminal.
