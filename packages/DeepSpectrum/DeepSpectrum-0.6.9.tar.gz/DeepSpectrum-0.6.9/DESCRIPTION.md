**DeepSpectrum** is a Python toolkit for feature extraction from audio data with pre-trained Image Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It features an extraction pipeline which first creates visual representations for audio data - plots of spectrograms or chromagrams - and then feeds them to a pre-trained Image CNN. Activations of a specific layer then form the final feature vectors.
