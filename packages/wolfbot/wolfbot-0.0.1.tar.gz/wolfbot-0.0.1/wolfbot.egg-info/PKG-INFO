        ## Introduction
        This is an implementation of the popular board game One Night Ultimate Werewolf.
        
        To try it out, run `python main.py` in the terminal.
        (You may need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you do not have tqdm already installed.)
        
        Constants, along with their use cases, are listed in src/const.py. You can change:
        - \# of players
        - \# of center cards
        - Which roles are used
        - Behavior of AI players on the Werewolf Team / Village Team
        
        ## Interactive Mode
        To play the game yourself as a character, use the `-u` / `--user` flag:
        ```
        python main.py --user
        ```
        
        To replay a game, add the `-r` / `--replay` flag.
        ```
        python main.py --user -r
        ```
        
        To examine verbose output of a game, use the `-l` / `--log_level` flag.
        ```
        python main.py -l trace
        ```
        
        ## Simulating Games
        To simulate many runs of the game, use the `-n` flag.
        ```
        python main.py -n 100
        ```
