# WiFi Pentesting Tips
I've tried to consolidate information from a variety of sources to
assist penetration testing during a wireless assessment. This list
includes plausible tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
I've decided to publish these in an easy to read, and hopefully digestible
blog fashion. Some of the items below will be updated occasionally,
with new attack vectors.

- Find a device, tool, software or environment that is reliable for RF
  testing. There are so many tools, wrappers and hardware to choose from

- Uncovering Hidden SSIDS: "Hidden SSID is a configuration
  where the access point does not broadcast its SSID in beacon frames"

- Building a Wireless Penetration Environment using Docker, "When
  Whales Fly"

- Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security

- By using your Let's Encrypt certificate
  you can effectively avoid internal SSL certificate issues, by not
  relying on self-signed certificates.

- There are a lot of devices you can use to test: "ESP32 WiFi Hash
  Monster, store EAPOL & PMKID packets in an SD card using a M5STACK /
  ESP32 device"

- Buy a WiFi Pineapple, "The WiFi PineappleÂ® NANO and TETRA are the
  6th generation pentest platforms from Hak5.

- Learn how to use MANA (https://github.com/sensepost/hostapd-mana),
  "SensePost's modified hostapd for wifi attacks"

- Download Wpa sycophant (https://github.com/sensepost/wpa_sycophant)
  for an EAP relay attack (https://w1f1.net/)

- Cheap WiFi hacks (http://deauther.com/)

- Wpa3-vuln: wpa_supplicant 2.7 vulnerable to Mathy's WPA3 bugs
  (https://github.com/sensepost/wpa3-vuln)

- The default TX-Power of most USB wireless cards is 20 dBm, but by
  issuing two commands you can increase your transmission power.
  (Type "iw reg set BO" then "iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30")

- Check out wiggle, there are a lot of of opportunities to use this data
  for offensive and defensive research.

- Captive Portal Attack
  (https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion/wiki/Captive-Portal-Attack)
  "attack attempts to retrieve the target access point's WPA/WPA2 key by
  means of a rogue network with a border authentication captive portal"

- crEAP is a python script that will identify WPA Enterprise mode EAP
  types and if insecure protocols are in use, will attempt to harvest
  usernames and/or handshakes)
  (https://www.shellntel.com/blog/2015/9/23/assessing-enterprise-wireless-network)

- You can deuathenticate a client by using
  a command like this: "aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -c
  00:0F:B5:34:30:30 ath0"

- Download Eaphammer, it allows targeted evil twin attacks against
  WPA2-Enterprise networks. Indirect wireless pivots using hostile
  portal attacks.

- Hcxdumptool is a small tool to capture packets from wlan devices

- Hcxtools is a portable solution for conversion of WiFi Hcxdumptool
  files to hashcat formats

- Freeradius-wpe: Though dated, still may have a valid use case during
  a wireless assessment

- Hostapd-wpe (The first hostapd Evil Twin implementation and my favorite
  tool for WPA2-Enterprise attacks)

- Use the additional WPE command line "-s" which return EAP-Success
  messages after credentials are harvested (See Understanding PEAP In-Depth)
  (https://sensepost.com/blog/2019/understanding-peap-in-depth/)

- Pwning WiFi-networks with bettercap and the PMKID client less attack
  (https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/02/13/Pwning-WiFi-networks-with-bettercap-and-the-PMKID-client-less-attack/)

- Build a pwnagtchi: Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based "AI"
  powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that
  learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize
  the crackable WPA key material it captures

- When actively scanning the client endpoint searches for wireless
  networks by transmitting probes and listening for responses from the
  access points within range

- During a passive scan, the client device waits for beacons,
  which are specific frames transmitted by the AP. (A probe response,
  also includes the configuration and capabilities of the wireless
  networks they service)

- Wifite2: Automates attacks that you may need against WPS/WEP)

- Some wireless penetration tests may require one to
  ask for credentials and log onto their guest network. This is okay
  and doesn't mean you have failed.

- Always check Guest Network for Client Isolation issues. Can I get to
  sensitive areas of the "Corporate" network, or any wired network from
  the isolated network used by contractors, etc.?

- Ensure that Client Isolation is on all wireless networks if possible.
  (If client isolation is off, then you can perform man-in-the-middle attacks.)

- Look for rogue access points by detaching your omni antenna, or using
  a directional antenna for better results.

- Look into Fluke gear if performing extensive rogue access point hunting
  or heat mapping.

- Use KRACK to ensure a wireless device that has not been patched or
  updated is not vulnerable to known attacks.

- TP-Link Archer C5 AC1200 is a Wireless Evil Twin Hardware Penetration
  Testing Router.

- Test the companies WIPS/WIPS by connecting a hardware rogue access
  point to the corporate network.

- Most "Ralink Wi-Fi chipset" cards work out the box with Kali .(The
  ALFA and Panda's in the gist below work out of the box with the latest
  Kali and can scan for 802.11ac clients)

- Antennas do matter, they have different signal patterns. These signal
  patterns make a difference.

- Signal/power are obviously important, clients will roam from different
  the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands based on signal strength and distance to the AP

- In an EAP downgrade attack, modify the eap.user file when running
  hostapd so that it downgrades the EAP connection to use EAP-GTC for
  authentication.
  (This will affect Android and iOS and Mac OS Supplicants to downgrade
  the victim's supplicant to use a less secure method. Let the clear
  text credentials rain in, aka getting some L00tbooty)

- Karma exploits a behaviour of some Wi-Fi devices, combined with the
  lack of access point authentication in numerous WiFi protocols. It is
  a variant of the evil twin attack. Details of the attack were first
  published in 2004 by Dino dai Zovi and Shaun Macaulay.

- Understand that you are not always trying to attack the access point,
  you must go after the user's device or PNL. (Preferred Network List)

- When it comes to taxonomy and identifying clients, you may find that one
  program, or suite of tools is better than the other for certain set tasks.

- Know Beacon Attack, "An attacker that can guess the ESSID of an
  open network in the victim device's Preferred Network List, will be
  able to broadcast the corresponding beacon frame and have that device
  automatically associate with an attacker-controlled access point"

- Ever get access to a network that was hardened, but it was a guest
  network? Set up your own Evil Twin network, using the real guest WPA2
  PSK. This is a technique I use to show why companies should rotate their
  guest network passwords, it can affect offices globally.
