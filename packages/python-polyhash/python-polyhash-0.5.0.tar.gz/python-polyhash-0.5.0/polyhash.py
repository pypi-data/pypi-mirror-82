    Given a Shapely polygon instance and a precision, identifies which
    geohashes are inside of or intersects the polygon depending on how
    strict the setting is. Resulting geohashes can be further compressed
    by one precision lower.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polygon : Shapely polygon
        Shapely polygon instance.
    precision : int
        Minimum precision of geohashes needed. If compress is True, this
        will become the maximum. The default is 6.
    strict : bool, optional
        If True, geohashes that fall on the border of the polygon are isolated
        from those that completely fall inside the polygon. The default is
        False, which combines the inner polygons with the border polygons.
    compress : bool, optional
        If True, resulting geohashes that completely comprise the members of

    border_mode : {'intersect', 'center'}, optional
        If 'center', border geohashes are determined only if their centroid
        falls inside the polygon. The default is 'intersect', which includes
        a geohash if it intersects any point in the polygon.

    -------
