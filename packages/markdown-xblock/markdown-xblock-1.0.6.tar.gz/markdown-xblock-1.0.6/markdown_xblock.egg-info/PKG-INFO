        # Markdown XBlock
        ### Based on the [HTML XBlock by OpenCraft](https://github.com/open-craft/xblock-html)
        
        ## Introduction
        This XBlock allows course authors to create and edit course content in Markdown
        and displays it as HTML.
        
        ## Installation
        You may install the markdown-xblock using its setup.py, or if you prefer to use pip, run:
        
        ```shell
        pip install markdown-xblock
        ```
        
        If you prefer to install directly from Git, run:
        
        ```shell
        pip install git+https://github.com/citynetwork/markdown-xblock.git
        ```
        
        You may specify the `-e` flag if you intend to develop on the repo.
        
        The minimum supported Python version is 3.5.
        
        To enable this block, add `"markdown"` to the course's advanced module list. 
        The option `Markdown` will appear in the advanced components.
        
        Once you've added a new `Markdown` component to your course, you can also add custom CSS classes to the component
        by selecting `EDIT`/`Settings` and adding to the `classes` list (Note: use double quotes `" "`). Example:
        ```
        ["custom-css-class-1", "custom-css-class-2"]
        ```
        
        The `Markdown` block uses [markdown2](https://pypi.org/project/markdown2/) to translate the content into HTML, 
        by default the following extras are included:
        
        * "code-friendly"
        * "fenced-code-blocks"
        * "footnotes"
        * "tables"
        * "use-file-vars"
        
        It is possible to configure more [extras](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/Extras), by adding to the extras list under `"markdown"` key in `XBLOCK_SETTINGS`
        at `/edx/etc/{studio|lms}.yml`
        
        By default, the `safe_mode` for `markdown2` library is enabled, which means that writing inline HTML is not allowed and if written, all tags will be replaced with `[HTML_REMOVED]`. To disable this setting and allow inline HTML, you'll need to set the `safe_mode` to `False` in `XBLOCK_SETTINGS`.
        
        Example:
        ```
        XBLOCK_SETTINGS:
            markdown:
                extras:
                    - code-friendly
                    - fenced-code-blocks
                    - footnotes
                    - header-ids
                    - metadata
                    - pyshell
                    - smarty-pants
                    - strike
                    - target-blank-links
                    - use-file-vars
                    - wiki-tables
                    - tag-friendly
                safe_mode: True
        ```
        
        ## Development
        If you'd like to develop on this repo or test it in [devstack](https://github.com/edx/devstack), clone this repo to your
        devstack's `~/workspace/src`, ssh into the appropriate docker container (`make lms-shell` and/or `make studio-shell`),
        run `pip install -e /edx/src/markdown-xblock`, and restart the service(s).
        
        
        ### Running tests
        The testing framework is built on [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After installing tox, you can run `tox` from your Git checkout of this repository.
        
        To throw away and rebuild the testing environment, run:
        ```shell
        $ tox -r
        ```
        For running PEP-8 checks only:
        ```shell
        $ tox -e flake8
        ```
