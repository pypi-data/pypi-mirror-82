Description: # kgrid-python-runtime
        KGrid runtime for Knowledge Objects in python
        
        
        Getting started:
        - Install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
        - Install pip
        
        - run `python -m pip install kgrid-python-runtime` to download the latest package
        - to start the server run `python -m kgrid_python_runtime`
        
        - Download Kgrid Python Runtime from github
        - Navigate to the folder containing `app.py`
        - In a terminal, install the required dependencies with:
        
            `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        - To start the Python runtime:
        
            `python kgrid_python_runtime/app.py runserver`
            
        - The runtime starts on port 5000, but can be specified with `KGRID_PYTHON_ENV_URL`
        - By default, the python runtime points to a Kgrid activator at url: 
            `http://localhost:8080`
            
            This can be customized by setting the environment variable:
            `KGRID_PROXY_ADAPTER_URL`
        - By default, the python runtime will tell the Kgrid Activator that it is started at `http://localhost:5000`.
            
            If you're starting the runtime at a different address, that url must be specified by setting the environment variable:
            `KGRID_PYTHON_ENV_URL`
            
        To run the tests:
        `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
