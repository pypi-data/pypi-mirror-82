Changelog
---------

0.9.2 (2020-10-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed some really bad bugs relating to fixtures


0.9.1 (2020-10-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed plugins dynamically adding implicit fixtures. This fixes pytest-django

* Implemented support for pytest.warns/hammett.warns

* Make cache default off, since it's still rather flaky


0.9.0 (2020-09-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for `caplog`

* Don't try to collect hidden files


0.8.0 (2020-09-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for the `capsys` feature from pytest

* Fixed verbose output

* Improved test feedback

* Support for class based tests (like unittest)

* Also search for *_test.py, since it seems pytest tries these

* Compatibility with a funny little pytest feature where you can pass a list and not a list of a list to parametrize if you have just one argument

* Pixed python 3.6 support

* Sort local variables in error output


0.7.1 (2020-05-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed pretty bad cache invalidation bug. You might need to delete your .hammett-db file.

* Attempt to get windows support


0.7.0 (2020-05-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added hammett specific tests files system. This means if you have a file `my_project/foo.py` hammett will look for `my_project/foo__tests.py` and `testt/foo__tests.py` for tests specific for that module.

* If you have module specific tests (see previous point), you can now run tests for a module with `hammett my_project.foo`

* Implemented a results cache. This means that if you haven't changed your source or tests hammett knows not to rerun the tests. If you have module specific tests it will run only the relevant tests for that module when you change the module.

* Added `hammett` command line. Beware of using this after doing `setup.py develop` as setuptools then adds a huge overhead.

* Support python 3.6

* Optimizations


0.6.0 (2020-05-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added --durations feature

* Improvements to skipping tests

* Run tests in lexiographic order

* Better assertion analysis

* You can now pass hammett a directory on the command line and it'll do the right thing

* Support names parameter of mark.parametrize() being a list/tuple


0.5.0 (2020-03-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented support for filtering tests based on markers. Also supports the marker[argument] syntax that goes beyond what pytest can do

* Nicer output on failed tests


0.4.0 (2020-03-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented module level markers

* Added --pdb command line arguement. This will try ipdb first, then pdb.

* Added noop @pytest.hookimpl support

* Improved feedback on assertion error

* Added -k flag (it's a bit more naive then in pytest, but it's fine for now)

* Implemented --durations

* Added support for test/ folder

* Corrected display for skipped


0.3.0 (2020-03-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for pytests `tmpdir` fixture

* Misc fixes


0.2.0 (2020-03-18)
