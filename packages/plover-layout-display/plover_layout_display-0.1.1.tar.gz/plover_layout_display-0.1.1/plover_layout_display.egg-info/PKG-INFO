        Custom Layouts
        ----------------
        
        You can customize the display in various ways by loading your own layout file. Layout file preferences are saved and loaded automatically for each stenography system that you use them for.
        
        See the `Plover Layout Display Wiki <https://github.com/morinted/plover_layout_display/wiki>`__ for other layout files as well as the format to create your own.
