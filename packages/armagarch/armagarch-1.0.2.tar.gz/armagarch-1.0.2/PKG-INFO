Description: # armagarch package
        The package provides a flexible framework for modelling time-series data. The main focus of the package is implementation of the ARMA-GARCH type models.
        
        **Full documentation is coming soon.**
        
        ## Installation
        
        The latest stable version can be installed by using pip
        ```
        pip install armagarch
        ```
        
        The master branch can be installed with
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/iankhr/armagarch
        cd armagarch
        python setup.py install
        ```
          
        
        ## Example: Modelling conditional volatility of the US excess market returns
        
        The code requires: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Shutil, Matplotlib, Pandas_datareader and Statsmodels
        
        
        ```
        import armagarch as ag
        import pandas_datareader as web
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        
        # load data from KennethFrench library
        ff = web.DataReader('F-F_Research_Data_Factors_daily', 'famafrench')
        ff = ff[0]
        
        # define mean, vol and distribution
        meanMdl = ag.ARMA(order = {'AR':1,'MA':0})
        volMdl = ag.garch(order = {'p':1,'q':1})
        distMdl = ag.normalDist()
        
        # create a model
        model = ag.empModel(ff['Mkt-RF'].to_frame(), meanMdl, volMdl, distMdl)
        # fit model
        model.fit()
        
        # get the conditional mean
        Ey = model.Ey
        
        # get conditional variance
        ht = model.ht
        cvol = np.sqrt(ht)
        
        # get standardized residuals
        stres = model.stres
        
        # make a prediction of mean and variance over next 3 days.
        pred = model.predict(nsteps = 3)
        
        # pred is a list of two-arrays with first array being prediction of mean
        # and second array being prediction of variance
