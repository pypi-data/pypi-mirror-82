    A callable to create and return a new connection object.

    The signature is not specified here because the

    the drivers for its database.

    This connection, and all objects created from it such as cursors,

    def cursor(connection, server_side=False):
        """
        Create and return a new cursor sharing the state of the given
        *connection*.

        The cursor should be closed when it is no longer needed. The
        cursor should be considered forward-only (no backward
        scrolling) and ephemeral (results go away when the attached
        transaction is committed or rolled back).

        For compatibility, previous cursors should not have
        outstanding results pending when this is called and while the
        returned cursor is used (not all drivers permit multiple
        active cursors).

        If *server_side* is true (not the default), request that the
        driver creates a cursor that will **not** buffer the complete
        results of a query on the client. Instead, the results should
        be streamed from the server in batches. This can reduce the
        maximum amount of memory needed to handle results, if done
        carefully.

        For compatibility, server_side cursors can only be used
        to execute a single query.

        Most drivers (``psycopg2``, ``psycopg2cffi``, ``pg8000``,
        ``mysqlclient``) default to buffering the entire results
        client side before returning from the ``execute`` method. This
        can reduce latency and increase overall throughput, but at the
        cost of memory, especially if the results will be copied into
        different data structures.

        Not all drivers support server-side cursors; they will ignore
        that request. At this writing, this includes ``pg8000``. Some
        drivers (at this writing, only ``gevent MySQLdb``) always use
        server-side cursors. The ``cx_Oracle`` driver is unevaluated.

        ``psycopg2`` and ``psycopg2cffi`` both iterate in chunks of
        ``cur.itersize`` by default. PyMySQL seems to iterate one row at a time.
        ``mysqlclient`` defaults to also iterating one row at a time, but
        we patch that to operate in chunks of ``cur.arraysize``.

        This is used in two modes. In the usual case, *commit* will be
        true, and this method is called to implement the final step of
        ``tpc_finish``. In that case, this method is responsible for
        committing the transaction (using the *store_connection*
        provided). When *commit* is false, this method is effectively
        part of ``tpc_vote`` and must **not** commit.

        The *blobhelper* is the :class:`IBlobHelper`. This method is
        responsible for moving blob data into place if the blob data
        is stored on the server and there are blobs in this
        transaction. (Implementations that use stored procedures will
        probably not need this argument; it is here to be able to
        provide ``txn_has_blobs`` to
        :meth:`IObjectMover.move_from_temp`.)

        *ude* is a tuple of ``(username, description, extension)``.

        If *committing_tid_int* is None, then this method must lock
        the database and choose the next TID as if by calling
        :meth:`lock_database_and_choose_next_tid` (passing in the
        expanded *ude*); if it is **not** None, the database has
        already been locked and the TID selected.

        *after_selecting_tid* is a function of one argument, the
        committing integer TID. If it is proveded, it must be called
        once the TID has been selected and temporary data moved into
        place.

        Implementations are encouraged to do all of this work in as
        few calls to the database as possible with a stored procedure
        (ideally one call). The default implementation will use
        :meth:`lock_database_and_choose_next_tid`,
        :meth:`IObjectMover.move_from_temp`,
        :meth:`IObjectMover.update_current` and
        :meth:`ITransactionControl.commit_phase1` and
        :meth:`ITransactionControl.commit_phase2`.

        When committing, implementations are encouraged to exit any
        :meth:`critical phase <IDBDriver.enter_critical_phase_until_transaction_end>`
        in the most timely manner possible after ensuring that the commit
        request has been sent, especially if only one
        communication with the database is required that may block for an arbitrary
        time to get the lock.

        the appropriate exceptions
        (:class:`UnableToLockRowsToModifyError` and
        :class:`UnableToLockRowsToReadCurrentError`, respectively).

        Because two separate classes of locks are to be obtained,
        implementations will typically need to make two separate
        locking queries. If the second of those queries fails, the
        implementation is encouraged to immediately release locks
        taken by the first operation before raising an exception.
        Ideally this happens in the database stored procedure.
        (PostgreSQL works this way automatically --- any error rolls
        the transaction back and releases locks --- but this takes
        work on MySQL except in the case of deadlock.)

        .. rubric:: Read Current Locks

        The *read_current_oids* maps OID integers to expected TID
        integers. Each such object must be read share locked for the
        duration of the transaction so we can ensure that the final
        commit occurs without those objects having been changed. From
        ReadVerifyingStorage's ``checkCurrentSerialInTransaction``:
        "If no [ReadConflictError] exception is raised, then the
        serial must remain current through the end of the
        transaction."

        Applications sometimes (often) perform readCurrent() on the
        *wrong* object (for example: the ``BTree`` object or the
        ``zope.container`` container object, when what is really
        required, what will actually be modified, is a ``BTree``
        bucket---very hard to predict), so very often these objects
        will not ever be modified. (Indeed, ``BTree.__setitem__`` and
        ``__delitem__`` perform readCurrent on the BTree itself; but
        once the first bucket has been established, the BTree will not
        usually be modified.) A share lock is enough to prevent any
        modifications without causing unnecessary blocking if the
        object would never be modified.

        In the results, if the ``tid_this_txn_saw_int`` is ``None``,
        that was an object we only read, and share locked. If the
        ``committed_tid_int`` does not match the TID we expected to
        get, then the caller will raise a ``ReadConflictError`` and
        abort the transaction. The implementation is encouraged to
        return all such rows *first* so that these inexpensive checks
        can be accomplished before the more expensive conflict
        resolution process.

        Optionally, if this method can detect a read current violation
        based on the data in *read_current_oids* at the database
        level, it may raise a :class:`ReadConflictError`. This method
        is also allowed and encouraged to *only* return read current
        violations; further, it need only return the first such
        violation (because an exception will immediately be raised.)

        Implementations are encouraged to use the database ``NOWAIT``
        feature (or equivalent) to take read current locks. If such an
        object is already locked exclusively, that means it is being
        modified and this transaction is racing the modification
        transaction. Taking the lock with ``NOWAIT`` and raising an
        error lets the write transaction proceed, while this one rolls
        back and retries. (Hopefully the write transaction finishes
        quickly, or several retries may be needed.)

        .. rubric:: Modified Objects and Conflicts

        All objects that this transaction intends to modify (which are
        in the ``temp_store`` table) must be exclusively write locked
        when this method returns.

        The remainder of the results (where ``tid_this_txn_saw_int``
        is not ``None``) give objects that we have detected a conflict
        (a modification that has committed earlier to an object this
        transaction also wants to modify).

        As an optimization for conflict resolution,
        ``committed_state`` may give the current committed state of
        the object (corresponding to ``committed_tid_int``), but is
        allowed to be ``None`` if there isn't an efficient way to
        query that in bulk from the database.

        .. rubric:: Deadlocks, and Shared vs Exclusive Locks

        It might seem that, because no method of a transaction
        (*except* for ``restore()``) writes directly to the
        ``object_state`` or ``current_object`` table *before*
        acquiring the commit lock, a share lock is enough even for
        objects we're definitely going to modify. That way leads to
        deadlock, however. Consider this order of operations:

            1. Tx a: LOCK OBJECT 1 FOR SHARE. (Tx a will modify this.)

            2. Tx b: LOCK OBJECT 1 FOR SHARE. (Tx b is just
               readCurrent.)

            3. Tx a: Obtain commit lock.

            4. Tx b: attempt to obtain commit lock; block.

            5. Tx a: UPDATE OBJECT 1; attempt to escalate shared lock
               to exclusive lock. --> DEADLOCK with the shared lock
               from step 2.

        Tx a needs to raise the lock of object 1, but Tx b's share
        lock is preventing it. Meanwhile, Tx b wants the commit lock,
        but Tx a is holding it.

        If Tx a took an exclusive lock, it would either block Tx b
        from getting a share lock, or be blocked by Tx b's share lock;
        either way, whichever one got to the commit lock would be able
        to complete.

        Further, it is trivial to show that when using two lock
        classes, two transactions that have overlapping sets of
        objects (e.g., a wants shared on ``(1, 3, 5, 7)`` and
        exclusive on ``(2, 4, 6, 8)`` and b wants shared on ``(2, 4,
        6, 8)`` and exclusive on ``(3, 5, 7)``), can easily deadlock
        *before* taking the commit lock, no matter how we interleave
        those operations. This is true if they both take their
        exclusive locks first and then attempt share locks on the
        remainder, both take shared locks on everything and attempt to
        upgrade to exclusive on that subset, or both take just the
        shared locks and then attempt to take the exclusive locks.
        This extends to more than two processes.

        **That's perfectly fine.**

        As long as the database either supports ``NOWAIT``
        (immediately error when you fail to get a requested lock) or
        rapid deadlock detection resulting in an error, we can catch
        that error and turn it into the ``ReadConflictError`` it
        actually is.

        PostgreSQL supports ``NOWAIT`` (and deadlock detection, after
        a small but configurable delay). MySQL's InnoDB supports rapid
        deadlock detection, and starting with MySQL 8, it supports
        ``NOWAIT``.

        .. rubric:: Lock Order

        The original strategy was to first take exclusive locks of
        things we will be modifying. Once that succeeds, then we
        attempt shared locks of readCurrent using ``NOWAIT``. If that
        fails because we can't get a lock, we know someone is in the
        process of modifying it and we have a conflict. If we get the
        locks, we still have to confirm the TIDs are the things we
        expect. (A possible optimization is to do those two steps at
        once, in the database. ``SELECT FOR SHARE WHERE oid = X and
        TID = x``. If we don't get the right number of rows,
        conflict.) This prioritizes writers over readers: readers fail
        at the expense of writers.

        However, it means that if we're going to fail a transaction
        because an object we'd like to read lock has been modified, we
        have to wait until we timeout, or acquire all of our exclusive
        locks. Depending on transaction ordering, this could mean
        unnecessarily long delays. Suppose Tx a wants to write to
        objects 1 and 2, and Tx b wants to write to 1 but only read 2.
        (Recall that a ZODB connection automatically upgrades
        readCurrent() into just modifications. 1 and 2 could be bank
        accounts; Tx a is doing a transfer, but Tx b is checking
        collateral (account 2) for a loan that was approved and
        transferring that into 1.)

            1. Tx a: LOCK 1, 2 EXCLUSIVE. (No share locks.)

            2. Tx b: LOCK 1 EXCLUSIVE. -> Block; queue for lock 1.

            3. Tx a: Resolve a conflict in 1, wait for the commit
               lock, and finally commit and release the locks on 1 and

            4. Tx c: LOCK 2 EXCLUSIVE.

            5. Tx b: LOCK 2 SHARE -> wait exception.

        Here, Tx b had to wait while Tx a finished its entire
        business, only to have Tx c swoop in and get the lock first,
        leading to Tx b raising an exception. Some databases guarantee
        that locks are handed off in FIFO fashion, but not all do.
        Even if the database granted Tb b the share lock first, it
        would still discover that the TID had changed and raise an
        exception. Meanwhile, Tx b has been holding an exclusive lock
        on 1 this entire time, preventing anyone else from modifying
        it.

        If we take the share locks first, the scenario looks like
        this:

            1. Tx a: LOCK 1, 2 EXCLUSIVE. (No share locks.)

            2. Tx b: LOCK 2 SHARE -> wait exception; begin retry.

        Tx b gets much quicker notification that it won't be able to
        progress and begins a retry.

        Both orders have the problem that if Tx a takes longer to
        commit than Tx b does to begin its retry, Tx b may take the
        same action against the same state of the database several
        times in a row before giving up. What's different is that in
        the exclusive first version, that only happens if Tx a and Tx
        b have no exclusive locks in common:

            1. Tx a: Lock 1 EXCLUSIVE.

            2. Tx b: Lock 2 EXCLUSIVE.

            3. Tx b: Lock 1 SHARE -> wait exception, begin retry.

        However, this can be mitigated by introducing small backoff
        delays in the transaction retry logic.

        Suppose a different transaction already modified object 2.
        With the original lock order (exclusive first), the scenario
        doesn't change. Tx b has to wait for Tx a to finish before it
        can determine that fact (Tx a has to resolve a conflict or
        fail). If Tx b got to go first, it would relatively quickly
        discover this fact, but at the cost of waiting for an
        exclusive lock for an arbitrary amount of time:

            1. Tx b: Lock 1 EXCLUSIVE. (Potentially blocks.)

            2. Tx a: Lock 1, 2 EXCLUSIVE. -> Block; queue for lock 1.

            3. Tx b: Lock 2 SHARE.

            4. Tx b: Determine 2 has been modified; raise
               ReadConflictError.

        Taking the share lock first solves this concern; Tx b is
        immediately able to determine that 2 has been modified and
        quickly raise an exception without holding any other locks.
