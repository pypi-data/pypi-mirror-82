Description: 
        e2e.common
        ==========
        
        Common code for the Python E2E package ecosystem.
        
        This package complies with PEP-484, PEP-526, and PEP-561 for distribution of
        type information.
        
        Core Modules
        ------------
        
        ``e2e.common.modelling``: Object-based Modelling Framework
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A modelling framework is provided by ``modelling.NamedParentable``, using
        metaclass construction to stitch instance parents together in a class-based
        modelling approach.
        
        For examples on how this is used, please see
        `e2e.pom <https://github.com/nickroeker/e2e.pom>`_ or
        `e2e.api <https://github.com/nickroeker/e2e.api>`_, as both packages use this
        modelling approach as of their 1.x releases.
        
        For the 1.0 release, only ``NamedParentable`` is provided and requires users to
        explicitly name instances of models for best-possible human-friendly logging.
        
        For the 2.0 release, options will exist for auto-naming and omission of the
        naming requirement. Stay tuned.
        
        ``e2e.common.utils``: General Utility Functions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Generalised utility functions reside in here. To reside here, they must be used
        by more than one e2e.* package.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        **Python 3.6+ is required** due to various metaclass and type-hinting
        functinality used. Backporting to 3.5 is possible with more significant effort
        and potential loss of certain features and type-hinting; please file an issue
        if you require this, explaining the motivation if possible.
        
        Other than that, this is a pure Python package and should be compatible with
        any OS and platform which Python runs on.
        
        Contributing & Development
        --------------------------
        
        I haven't put much thought into others contributing here. Please reach out if
        there are changes you'd like to make!
        
        The ``Makefile`` (which has only been tested on Linux distros) holds my
        development process:
        
        
        * ``make format``: to run ``black`` and ``isort`` formatters
        * ``make lint``: to run ``mypy`` (type check), ``pylint``, and ``flake8``
        * ``make test``: to run unit tests
        * ``make tox``: to run unit tests on multiple Python versions
        * ``make wheel`` and ``make sdist``: to build such package archives
        
        Otherwise, this is a fairly standard package repo using virtual environments
        and ``setup.py``.
        
        Note that the build environment (no unnecessary packages) is different from the
        development environment (contains all packages for development).
