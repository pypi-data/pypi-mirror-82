# H5Info Package

This Python package contains the necessary tools to extract data and metadata from HDF5 files generated by Phenomobile acquisition in the context of the Phenome project by INRA, France.

The API of the H5Info package exposes 3 methods:

- ``load_data()``: to extract data from a HDF5 file and store it into a H5Info structure
- ``save_metadata()``: to save a H5Info metadata structure into a JSON  file
- ``load_metadata()``: to load a H5Info metadata structure from a JSON file

Please refer to the ``main.py`` script for an example about how to use these three methods
