        # Description
        The purpose of this package is it to offer an easy way
        to create a petrinet, you can use for process mining, without having a full PNML file.
        All you need is a simple list of your process steps, the number of your step and the number 
        of all Previous Steps.
        
        ### This is just the first Version of the Package. I will try to develop more possible outputs when i got time.
        
        # Classes
        The package offers the following classes:

          - output([tablename])
          - cel_out([tablename])
