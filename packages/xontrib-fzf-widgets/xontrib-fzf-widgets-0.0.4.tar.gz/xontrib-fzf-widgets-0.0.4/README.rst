This extension will add some fzf widgets to your xonsh shell that you can bind and use as follows:

Current widgets
----------------

- **ssh:** Search in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` or `~/.ssh/config` items and issue `ssh` command on the chosen item.
- **history insert:** Search in all history entries and insert the chosen command to the prompt.
- **find file:** Find one or more files in the current directory and its sub-directories.
- **find directory:** Similar to the previous one, but intended to only search for directories.

How to use it
----------------

Install the package:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install xontrib-fzf-widgets

Enable it by adding `fzf-widgets` to your `~/.xonshrc` file:

.. code-block:: python

    xontrib load fzf-widgets

And set your desired keybindings for each widget in `~/.xonshrc` file or set it to `None` to disable it:

.. code-block:: python

    $fzf_history_binding = "c-r"  # Ctrl+R
    $fzf_ssh_binding = "c-s"      # Ctrl+S
    $fzf_file_binding = "c-t"      # Ctrl+T
    $fzf_dir_binding = "c-g"      # Ctrl+G

You can find the names of various keys here_ in ``python-prompt-toolkit``.

.. _here: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/keys.py

Other configuration variables:

- ``$fzf_find_command``: A command used by `fzf` to search for files.
- ``$fzf_find_dirs_command``: A command used by `fzf` to search for directories.

.. code-block:: python

    $fzf_find_command = "fd"
    $fzf_find_dirs_command = "fd -t d"

Troubleshooting
----------------
- If `fzf` shows garbled file names like ``[1;38;5;63maur[0m``, those extra characters are terminal control codes. That most probably means your file finder is set up to produce colorized output. You can either change your ``$fzf_find_command`` and ``$fzf_find_dirs_command`` to remove the coloring or add ``--ansi`` switch to your ``$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`` environment variable if you want to preserve the colors. See ``man 1 fzf`` for details.
