Description: # Discover
        Yet another discord overlay for linux written in Python using GTK3
        
        Considerably lighter on system resources and less hack-and-slash included than discord-overlay.

        ## Installing
        
        ### Stable
        ```
        python3 -m pip install discover-overlay
        ```
        
        ### Latest Testing
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/trigg/Discover.git
        cd Discover
        python3 -m pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Most requirements should be handled by pip.
        
        A compositor is strongly advised but there is a non-compositor mode optionally
        
        It is advised to install python-gobject from your own package manager.
        
        #### Debian/Ubuntu
        
        `apt install python3-gi`
        
        #### Arch
        
        `pacman -S python-gobject`
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        run `discover-overlay` if this fails it is most likely in `~/.local/bin/discover-overlay`
        
        Comes with sane-enough default but has a configuration screen to tweak to your own use. Configuration can be reached either via System tray or by running `discover-overlay --configure`
        
        
        ## Why do you keep making Discord Overlays?
        
        I feel like I shouldn't have to at all! Until we get an official one I might just create a new one every few months. Look forward to Rust/Vulkan version coming in a few months.
        
        ### Are you serious?
        
        Generally, no.
