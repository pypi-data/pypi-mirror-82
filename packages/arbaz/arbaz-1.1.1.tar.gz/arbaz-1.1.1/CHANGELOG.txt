gsheets is a small wrapper around the Google Sheets API (v4) to provide more convenient access to Google Sheets from Python scripts.

Turn on the API, download an OAuth client ID as JSON file, and create a Sheets object from it. Use its index access (sheet.get_all_records()) to retrieve SpreadSheet objects by their id, or use .get() with a sheet URL. Iterate over the Sheets object for all spreadsheets, or fetch spreadsheets by title with the .find() and .findall() methods.
