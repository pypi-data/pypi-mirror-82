Description: Utilities library with several more or less independent components
        
        This library is mainly intended for myself, so I can access it from
        anywhere. But anyone else is welcome to have a look. Documentation
        is still lacking, I know, but that shall change. Testing is better.
        
        The full documentation (well, what already exists of it) for this
        version is at
        <https://git.w21.org/ni/jpylib/-/blob/v2020.1011.1220/README.md>
