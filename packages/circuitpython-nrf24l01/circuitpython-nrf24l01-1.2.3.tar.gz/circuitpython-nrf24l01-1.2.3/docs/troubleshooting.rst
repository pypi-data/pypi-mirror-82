
Troubleshooting info
====================

.. important:: The nRF24L01 has 3 key features that can be interdependent of each other. Their
    priority of dependence is as follows:

    1. `auto_ack` feature provides transmission verification by using the RX nRF24L01 to
       automatically and imediatedly send an acknowledgment (ACK) packet in response to
       received payloads. `auto_ack` does not require `dynamic_payloads` to be enabled.
    2. `dynamic_payloads` feature allows either TX/RX nRF24L01 to be able to send/receive
       payloads with their size written into the payloads' packet. With this disabled, both
       RX/TX nRF24L01 must use matching
       :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.payload_length` attributes. For
       `dynamic_payloads` to be enabled, the `auto_ack` feature must be enabled. Although,
       the `auto_ack` feature can be used when the `dynamic_payloads` feature is disabled.
    3. `ack` feature allows the MCU to append a payload to the ACK packet, thus instant
       bi-directional communication. A transmitting ACK payload must be loaded into the
       nRF24L01's TX FIFO buffer (done using `load_ack()`) BEFORE receiving the payload that
       is to be acknowledged. Once transmitted, the payload is released from the TX FIFO
       buffer. This feature requires the `auto_ack` and `dynamic_payloads` features enabled.

Remeber that the nRF24L01's FIFO (first-in,first-out) buffer has 3 levels. This means that
there can be up to 3 payloads waiting to be read (RX) and up to 3 payloads waiting to be
transmit (TX).

With the `auto_ack` feature enabled, you get:

    * cyclic redundancy checking (`crc`) automatically enabled
    * to change amount of automatic re-transmit attempts and the delay time between them.
      See the `arc` and `ard` attributes.

.. note:: A word on pipes vs addresses vs channels.

    You should think of the data pipes as a "parking spot" for your payload. There are only six
    data pipes on the nRF24L01, thus it can simultaneously "listen" to a maximum of 6 other
    nRF24L01 radios. However, it can only "talk" to 1 other nRF24L01 at a time).

    The specified address is not the address of an nRF24L01 radio, rather it is more like a
    path that connects the endpoints. When assigning addresses to a data pipe, you can use any
    5 byte long address you can think of (as long as the first byte is unique among
    simultaneously broadcasting addresses), so you're not limited to communicating with only
    the same 6 nRF24L01 radios.

    Finnaly, the radio's channel is not be confused with the radio's pipes. Channel selection
    is a way of specifying a certain radio frequency (frequency = [2400 + channel] MHz).
    Channel defaults to 76 (like the arduino library), but options range from 0 to 125 --
    that's 2.4 GHz to 2.525 GHz. The channel can be tweaked to find a less occupied frequency
    amongst Bluetooth, WiFi, or other ambient signals that use the same spectrum of
    frequencies.

.. warning::
    For successful transmissions, most of the endpoint trasceivers' settings/features must
    match. These settings/features include:

    * The RX pipe's address on the receiving nRF24L01 (passed to `open_rx_pipe()`) MUST match
      the TX pipe's address on the transmitting nRF24L01 (passed to `open_tx_pipe()`)
    * `address_length`
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.channel`
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.data_rate`
    * `dynamic_payloads`
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.payload_length` only when `dynamic_payloads`
      is disabled
    * `auto_ack` on the recieving nRF24L01 must be enabled if `arc` is greater than 0 on the
      transmitting nRF24L01
    * custom `ack` payloads
    * `crc`

    In fact the only attributes that aren't required to match on both endpoint transceivers
    would be the identifying data pipe number (passed to `open_rx_pipe()` or `load_ack()`),
    :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.pa_level`, `arc`, & `ard` attributes. The
    ``ask_no_ack`` feature can be used despite the settings/features configuration (see
    `send()` & `write()` function parameters for more details).

About the lite version
======================

This library contains a "lite" version of ``rf24.py`` titled ``rf24_lite.py``. It has been
developed to save space on microcontrollers with limited amount of RAM and/or storage (like
boards using the ATSAMD21 M0). The following functionality has been removed from the lite
version:

    * The `FakeBLE` class is not compatible with the ``rf24_lite.py`` module.
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.is_plus_variant` is removed, meaning the
      lite version is not compatibility with the older non-plus variants of the nRF24L01.
    * `address()` removed.
    * :py:func:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.what_happened()` removed. However you can
      use the following function to dump all available registers' values (for advanced users):

      .. code-block:: python

          # let `nrf` be the instantiated RF24 object
          def dump_registers(end=0x1e):
              for i in range(end):
                  if i in (0xA, 0xB, 0x10):
                      print(hex(i), "=", nrf._reg_read_bytes(i))
                  elif i not in (0x18, 0x19, 0x1a, 0x1b):
                      print(hex(i), "=", hex(nrf._reg_read(i)))
    * `dynamic_payloads` applies to all pipes, not individual pipes.
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.payload_length` applies to all pipes, not
      individual pipes.
    * `read_ack()` removed. This is deprecated on next major release anyway; use `recv()`
      instead.
    * `load_ack()` is available, but it will not throw exceptions for malformed ``buf`` or
      invalid ``pipe_number`` parameters.
    * `crc` removed. 2-bytes encoding scheme (CRC16) is always enabled.
    * `auto_ack` removed. This is always enabled for all pipes. Pass ``ask_no_ack`` parameter
      as `True` to `send()` or `write()` to disable automatic acknowledgement for TX
      operations.
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.is_lna_enabled` removed as it only affects
      non-plus variants of the nRF24L01.
    * :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.pa_level` is available, but it will not
      accept a `list` or `tuple`.
    * `rpd`, `start_carrier_wave()`, & `stop_carrier_wave()` removed. These only perform a
      test of the nRF24L01's hardware.
    * `CSN_DELAY` removed. This is hard-coded to 5 milliseconds
    * All comments and docstrings removed, meaning ``help()`` will not provide any specific
      information. Exception prompts have also been reduced and adjusted accordingly.
    * Cannot switch between different radio configurations using context manager (the `with`
      blocks). It is advised that only one `RF24` object be instantiated when RAM is limited
      (less than or equal to 32KB).


Testing nRF24L01+PA+LNA module
=================================

The following are semi-successful test results using a nRF24L01+PA+LNA module:

The Setup
*********************************

    I wrapped the PA/LNA module with electrical tape and then foil around that (for shielding)
    while being very careful to not let the foil touch any current carrying parts (like the GPIO pins and the soldier joints for the antenna mount). Then I wired up a PA/LNA module with a 3V
    regulator (L4931 with a 2.2 ÂµF capacitor between V\ :sub:`out` & GND) using my ItsyBitsy M4
    5V (USB) pin going directly to the L4931 V\ :sub:`in` pin. The following are experiences from
    running simple, ack, & stream examples with a reliable nRF24L01+ (no PA/LNA) on the other end (driven by a Raspberry Pi 2):

Results (ordered by :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.pa_level` settings)
***********************************************************************************

    * 0 dBm: ``master()`` worked the first time (during simple example) then continuously failed
      (during all examples). ``slave()`` worked on simple & stream examples, but the opposing
      ``master()`` node reporting that ACK packets (without payloads) were **not** received from
      the PA/LNA module; ``slave()`` failed to send ACK packet payloads during the ack example.
    * -6 dBm: ``master()`` worked consistently on simple, ack, & stream example. ``slave()`` worked
      reliably on simple & stream examples, but failed to transmit **any** ACK packet payloads in
      the ack example.
    * -12 dBm: ``master()`` worked consistently on simple, ack, & stream example. ``slave()``
      worked reliably on simple & stream examples, but failed to transmit **some** ACK packet
      payloads in the ack example.
    * -18 dBm: ``master()`` worked consistently on simple, ack, & stream example. ``slave()``
      worked reliably on simple, ack, & stream examples, meaning **all** ACK packet payloads were
      successfully transmit in the ack example.

    I should note that without shielding the PA/LNA module and using the L4931 3V regulator,
    no TX transmissions got sent (including ACK packets for the
    :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.auto-ack` feature).

Conclusion
*********************************

    The PA/LNA modules seem to require quite a bit more power to transmit. The L4931 regulator
    that I used in the tests boasts a 300 mA current limit and a typical current of 250 mA.
    While the ItsyBitsy M4 boasts a 500 mA max, it would seem that much of that is consumed
    internally. Since playing with the :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.pa_level`
    is a current saving hack (as noted in the datasheet), I can only imagine that a higher power
    3V regulator may enable sending transmissions (including ACK packets -- with or without ACK
    payloads attached) from PA/LNA modules using higher
    :py:attr:`~circuitpython_nrf24l01.rf24.RF24.pa_level` settings. More testing is called for,
    but I don't have an oscilloscope to measure the peak current draws.
