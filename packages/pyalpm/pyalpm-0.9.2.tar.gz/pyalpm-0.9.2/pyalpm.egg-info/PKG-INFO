Description: #  pyalpm - python bindings for the libalpm library
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/archlinux/pyalpm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/archlinux/pyalpm) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyalpm/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyalpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        pyalpm is a C extension for Python 3 that give access to the
        libalpm API for package management, which is used, for example
        in the Arch Linux distribution.
        
        # Requirements
        
        * Python 3 or later
        
        * libalpm 10 or later
        
        * python-setuptools
        
        * python-sphinx (optional, to build the docs)
        
        # Building
        
        Building is as easy as running make
        
        	make
        
        Building the docs:
        
        	make -C doc html
        
        # Testing
        
        Required test dependency:
        
        * python-pytest
        * gcovr (optional, generating C coverage) 
        
        Unit tests can be run with:
        
        	make test
        
        Coverage for Python code can be generated as following:
        
        	make open-coverage
        
        Coverage for the CPython code can be generated as following:
        
        	make open-ext-coverage
        
        # Releasing
        
        1. Bump version in setup.py
        2. commit
        3. git tag
        
        ## Uploading to PyPI
        
        1. python3 setup.py sdist
        2. twine upload -s dist/* --verbose
        
        # Pacman development compatibility
        
        The master branch tracks the most recent pacman release and thus libalpm
        release, the [next](https://github.com/archlinux/pyalpm/tree/next) branch
        follows [pacman's master branch](https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/).
