Linguistic and Stylistic Complexity
===================================

This project implements various measures that assess the linguistic
and stylistic complexity of (literary) texts. All surface-based,
sentence-based and dependency-based complexity measures are language
independent. Some of the constituency-based measures are also language
independent, but most rely on the NEGRA parsing scheme, i.e. can only
be applied to German data.
