# pyQAserver

QAserver connects [Pylinac](https://github.com/jrkerns/pylinac) and [Orthanc](https://github.com/jodogne/Orthanc) with a simplistic web interface. It was built to speed up the image analysis process with Pylinac, without having to switch computers or work manually with dicom files. The procedure is easy: acquire the image, send the image from the imaging computer directly to Orthanc, and then analyze it with Pylinac by using QAserver. Since all images are stored in Orthanc, you can re-analyze them anytime you want. You can do the analysis on any computer in your network.
