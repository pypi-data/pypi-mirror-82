# BeamNGpy

[![Documentation](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/documentation.png)][1]

## About

BeamNGpy is an official library providing a Python interface to BeamNG.research,
the research-oriented fork of the video game BeamNG.drive.

It allows remote control of the simulation, including vehicles contained in it:

![Steering control](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/steering.gif)

Vehicles and the environment can be equipped with various sensors that provide
simulated sensor data such as a camera feed, with options for depth values and
pixel-perfect semantic annotation or a simulated Lidar sensor:

## Prerequisites

Usage of BeamNGpy requires BeamNG.research to be installed. Builds of
BeamNG.research are made available for non-commercial use upon request using
[this form][2]. For commercial use, contact us at [licensing@beamng.gmbh][3].
Once downloaded (and extracted, depending on whether or no BeamNG.research was
obtained as a `.zip`), you can set an environment variable `BNG_HOME` to where
BeamNG.research can be run from, or provide a path to the BeamNGpy library
during initialization.

The regular [Steam release of BeamNG.drive][4] is compatible to an extent as
well. Certain sensors like the simulated LiDAR or camera will not work, but
most of the functions that are not exclusive to a research build will likely
work.

## Installation

The library itself is available on [PyPI][5] and can therefore be installed
using common methods like `pip`:

    pip install beamngpy

## Usage

Once installed, the library can be imported using `import beamngpy`. A short
usage example setting up a scenario with one vehicle in the West Coast USA map
that spans the area is:

```python
from beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle

# Instantiate BeamNGpy instance running the simulator from the given path,
# communicating over localhost:64256
bng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256, home='/path/to/bng/research')
# Create a scenario in west_coast_usa called 'example'
scenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'example')
# Create an ETK800 with the licence plate 'PYTHON'
vehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800', licence='PYTHON')
# Add it to our scenario at this position and rotation
scenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(-717, 101, 118), rot=None, rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))
# Place files defining our scenario for the simulator to read
scenario.make(bng)

# Launch BeamNG.research
bng.open()
# Load and start our scenario
bng.load_scenario(scenario)
bng.start_scenario()
# Make the vehicle's AI span the map
vehicle.ai_set_mode('span')
input('Hit enter when done...')
```

the documentation of the library is [available here.][7].
