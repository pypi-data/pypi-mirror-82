"""Alhazen is a small, simple framework to facilitate running experiments, written in
Python, using cognitive models, or similar applications, in multiple, parallel processes.
It is only useful on multi-core machines, though most modern machines are such; the more
cores, the more performance benefit you are likely to get by using it. It also depends
upon the experiment being structured as a large number of identical, independent runs of
the same activity, or of similar activities. This is a common pattern, each such run
usually corresponding to a distinct virtual participant, or possibly a collection of
interacting participants.

When an Alhazen experiment is run the initial process is used as a parent, controller
process and it spawns one or more child, worker processes to run the individual tasks.
Alhazen handles partitioning the sub-tasks between these workers, and collecting their
results, which can then be aggregated in the parent, controller process. To use Alhazen
you make a subclass of its :class:`Experiment` or :class:`IteratedExperiment` class,
override some of its methods to describe what the workers should do and what results to
return and aggregate, declare how many workers to use, and then call its :meth:`run`
method.

    """An abstract base class, concrete subclasses of which define experiments that can be
    run a collection of independent tasks, possibly distributed to multiple worker
    processes when run on on a multi-core machine. A subclass of :class:`Experiment` must
    at least override the :meth:`run_participant` method; typically it will override one
    or more other methods.

    The *participants*, if supplied, it should be a positive integer, the number of
    virtual participants to run. If not supplied it defaults to 1.

    The *conditions*, if supplied, should be an iterable of values that are both hashable
    and `picklable <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html#pickle-picklable>`_.
    These denote different conditions in which the task of the :class:`Experiment` should
    be run, and all *participants* are run once against each condition. Multiple,
    orthogonal sets of conditions are often most easily represented as tuples of elements
    of the underlying individual sets of conditions.

    The *process_count*, if supplied, should be a non-negative integer. If non-zero it
    is the number of worker processes to use. Note that the overall program will actually
    contain one more process than this, the control process, which is also the main
    process in which the :class:`Experiment`'s :meth:`run` method is called. If
    *process_count* is zero (the default if not supplied) it indicates that the number
    of worker processes to be used should be the number of cores available, as determined
    by Python's ``os`` module. Note that on Intel processors supporting them this count
    will include the "virtual" cores supplied by
    `Hyper-threading <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading>`_. In this case it
    may sometimes be advantageous to use a lower number.

    By default when an :class:`Experiment` is running a
    `tqdm <https://tqdm.github.io/>`_ progress indicator is shown, advanced as each task
    is completed. This may be suppressed by setting *show_progress* to ``False``.
