        Python monkey-patching for Humans
        =================================
        
        *Altered States* is a reversible state tool. It changes values in an
        object. When the changes are not needed anymore, it is possible to
        reverse them.

        1.0.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed issue in setup.py script
        * Added missing changelog
        
        1.0.0
        -----
        
        * Altered States now runs on Python 3 (tested on 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6)
        * Dropped support for Python 2.6
        * Experimental support for Kenneth Reitz Pipenv tool
        * Corrected invalid use of `os.modules` in examples
        
        0.8.6
        -----
        
        * Better handling of objects that override `__getitem__` (thanks to
          @merwok).
        * Drop support for Python 2.5 (no sane way to solve issue #4 there).
        
        0.8.5
        -----
        
        * Added a new API entry point: `alter()`, that can be used to perform
          a two-step reversible alteration.
        
        0.8.2
        -----
        
        * Updated test suites to use `@pytest.fixture` notation for fixtures
          (now requires `py.test` > 2.3)
        * Fixes a bug causing `os.environ` not to be patchable.
        
        Fixing bug #2 means switching the `dict` -like object check from
        `isinstance(x, dict)` to `hasattr(x, '__getitem__')`. This change is
        thought to not break backwards compatibility but if you encounter
        unexpected behaviour in `dict` / `object` detection this might be
        it. I'd be very interested to know about that if you do.
        
        0.8.1
        -----
        
        * Alias `Expando` as `E` for optional terseness.
        
        0.8.0
        -----
        
        Initial release.
