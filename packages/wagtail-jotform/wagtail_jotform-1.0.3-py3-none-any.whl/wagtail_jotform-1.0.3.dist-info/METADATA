# Wagtail Jotform

Embedable Jotform forms for Wagtail pages.

Wagtail Jotform works by providing a new page type, EmbeddedFormPage with a form choice field. Values for this form field are populated from the Jotform API.

## Installation

Install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/wagtail-jotform/):

```
pip install wagtail-jotform
```

## Configuration

You will need an API key from jotform.
Add the following variables to your settings.

```
WAGTAIL_JOTFORM = {
    "API_KEY": "somekey",
    "API_URL": "https://api.jotform.com",
}
```

If your Jotform account is in EU safe mode, your JOTFORM_API_URL should be `https://eu-api.jotform.com`

Add the following to you INSTALLED_APPS in settings, note that wagtail_jotform depends on routable_page:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'wagtail_jotform',
    "wagtail.contrib.routable_page",
]
```

## Thank you page

Thank you pages work via [RoutablePageMixin](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/reference/contrib/routablepage.html).

When a form is created, the Jotform `thankurl` is set with your created forms thankyou page url. E.G `https://mysite.com/formpage/thank-you`. So when the form is submitted, the user will be redirected accordingly and be show the 'thank you' data specified on on the form page added.

## Overriding tempaltes

Wagtail Jotform has 2 templates:

```
embedded_form_page.html
thank_you.html
```

You can override these templates in your project by adding them in the following location:

```
your_project_root/
  templates/
    wagtial_jotform/
        embed_form_page.html
        thank_you.html
```

## Tests

```
coverage run ./runtest.py
coverage report
```
