This Python package provides a CLI, a web API server, and library, to:

- get station information and departures from public transport operators,
- update a virtual or physical departure board with departure information for a station.

Departure has out-of-the-box support for the following operators:

- [London Underground](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/) (UK),
- [National Rail](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) (UK),
- [Nederlandse Spoorwegen](https://www.ns.nl/) (Netherlands)
- [RATP](https://www.ratp.fr/) (France),
- [SNCF](https://www.sncf.com/) (France),
- [Transilien](https://www.transilien.com/) (France).

Departure information can be sent to a departure board server that supports the [Departure protocol buffer message format](https://github.com/spujadas/departure-proto).

As an illustration, the image below was created using the [Python Departure board server](https://github.com/spujadas/departure-board-servers-python) running the Pygame back end.

The video clip below was made using a physical LED matrix board running the [C++ Departure board server](https://github.com/spujadas/departure-board-servers-cpp) on a Raspberry Pi.

The [official web front end](https://github.com/spujadas/departure-front-end) provides a human-friendly way to interact with the web API server.
