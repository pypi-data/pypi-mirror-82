        # cpyvke
        Curses PYthon Variable and Kernel Explorer
        
        ![A Basic Client](https://github.com/ipselium/cpyvke/blob/master/docs/pydev.png)
        
        
        cpyvke is a variable explorer and a kernel manager written in Python 3 ncurses
        for iPython kernels (Python 2.x or 3.x).
        cpyvke supports inspection of numpy ndarray among others types, and provides a set of
        tools to visualize and plot data.
        
        Be aware that cpyvke is **still in development** : A lot of bugs are definitely there !
        
        Note that this version only works with Python 3.x. The Python 2.7 version is no
        longer maintened !

        ## Installation
        
        `git clone https://github.com/ipselium/cpyvke.git`
        `python3 setup.py install`
        
        ### or
        
        pip install cpyvke

        ## Quick Start
        
        To start working, just launch `cpyvke` in a console. It will create a new kernel, start the daemon and launch the client :
        
        `cpyvke`
        
        You can also launch `cpyvke-launch-ipython` to open the current kernel :
        
        `cpyvke-launch-ipython`
        
        You can now work in this Ipython console and cpyvke will display all changes in the associated kernel :
        
        `In [1] : run my_program.py`
        
        
        ## Tips
        
        You can also use : https://github.com/ipselium/vim-cpyvke
        
        **vim-cpyvke** provides tools to evaluate blocks of code or full scripts
        directly from vim. The duo **cpyvke/vim-cpyvke** paired with a vim plugin such
        as **python-mode** (www.github.com/klen/python-mode) can provide a complete
        development environment for Python in console.

        ## Manuals
        
        ### kd5 : The Daemon
        
        *Usage: kd5 {start|stop|restart|list} [INTEGER]*
        
        * start : start daemon. If no [INTEGER] is provided, a new ipython kernel is created. [INTEGER] is the id of the connection file.
        * stop : stop daemon
        * restart : restart daemon
        * list : list available ipython kernels
        
        ### cpyvke : The client
        
        *Usage: cpyvke [-h] [-L] [-D] [integer]*
        
        * positional arguments:
        	* [integer] : Start up with existing kernel. INTEGER is the id of the connection file.
        
        * optional arguments:
        	* [-h], [--help] : show this help message and exit
        	* [-D], [--debug] : Debug mode
        	* [-L], [--list] : List all kernels
        
        * bindings:
        	* **h** : help
        	* **ENTER** : Validate/Item menu
        	* **q|ESC** : Previous menu/quit'
        	* **s** : sort by name/type
        	* **l** : limit display to all variable matching the given keyword
        	* **u** : undo limit
        	* **k** : kernel manager
        	* **/** : Search for variable
        	* **q** : previous menu -- quit
        	* **r** : Refresh explorer
        	* **c-r** : Restart Daemon
        	* **R** : Restart connection to daemon
        	* **D** : Disconnect from daemon
        	* **C** : Connect to daemon
        	* **↓** : Next line
        	* **↑** : Previous line
        	* **→|↡** Next page
        	* **←|↟** Previous page
        
        ### Setup workspace
        
        * You can directly launch `cpyvke`. It will create a new kernel, start the daemon and launch the client
        * cpyvke-launch-ipython automatically launch the current ipython console
        * You can also manually open an existing ipython instance like this :
        	`ipython console --existing kernel-xxxxx.json`
        where xxxxx is the id of the kernel
        
        ### Note
        
        If you just want to test cpyvke without installing. In cpyvke/ directory :
        
        * launch kd5 first : `python3 -m cpyvke.kd5 start`
        * then launch cpyvke : `python3 -m cpyvke.cpyvke`
        * and launch ipython in another console : `python3 -m cpyvke.launch`

        ## Configuration
        
        ![Configuration](https://github.com/ipselium/cpyvke/blob/master/docs/array.png)
        
        A configuration file *cpyvke.conf* is created in `$HOME/.cpyvke/` at first startup. Appearance of the client can be customize (colors, font).
        
        ### Colors
        
        The available colors are...
        
        * black
        * red
        * green
        * yellow
        * blue
        * magenta
        * cyan
        * white
        
        ### Fonts
        
        cpyvke can also display powerline fonts. You can find them here :
        https://github.com/powerline/fonts.
        
        Add the following section in `$HOME/.cpyvke/cpyvke.conf`:
        
        `[font]`
        
        `powerline-font = True`
        
        ### Python kernel version
        
        The cpyvke/kd5 duo handles python 2.x or 3.x kernel equally. To setup the Python kernel you'll want to use :
        
        `[kernel version]`
        
        `version = 3`
        
        The `version` can be 2 or 3 for python 2.x kernel or 3.x kernel, respectively.
