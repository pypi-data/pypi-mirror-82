## Installation

Install nhlapip with pip:

```bash
pip install nhlapip
```

## Usage

### With Python

The API is exposed via endpoint-based classes. See [below for a full list of endpoints](#currently-implemented-endpoints). Some quick examples:

```python
# Player Data for Joe Sakic
from nhlapip.player import Player
sakic = Player('8451101')
print(sakic.get_data())

# Player's All Seasons Statistics
print(sakic.get_stats_allseasons())

# All Teams' Rosters
from nhlapip.team import Team
all_teams = Team()
print(all_teams.get_roster())
```

Many usage examples can be found in the [Pandas showcase](ci/pandas_showcase.py) that shows data retrieval for many endpoints.

### Command line interface (CLI)

A very simple CLI is also available. This is still in active development. Some examples:

```bash
echo '\n\Get data nhlapip for 1 player:\n'
nhlapip Player 8451101

echo '\n\nGet data for 2 Teams :\n'
nhlapip Team 1 2
```

Many usage examples can be found in the [CLI showcase](ci/cli_showcase.sh) that shows CLI data retrieval for many endpoints.

## NHL API data for R users

This package is a Python port of a more mature and feature-rich R package `{nhlapi}`. If you are an R user, please check the package out on [GitHub](https://github.com/jozefhajnala/nhlapi) and on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nhlapi).
