        Code for use by external users
        ------------------------------
        
        The only code that should be used directly by users is the ``libcoveoc4ids.config`` and ``libcoveoc4ids.api`` modules.
        
        Other code (in ``lib``, etc.) should not be used by external users of this library directly, as the structure and use of these may change more frequently.
