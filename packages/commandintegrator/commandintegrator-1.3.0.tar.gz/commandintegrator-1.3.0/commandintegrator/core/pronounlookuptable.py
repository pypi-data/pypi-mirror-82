Module details:
    
    The PronounLookupTable object is built to work
    statically as a way to identify pronouns in 
    a scentence, with the ultimate goal to make
    developing command driven applications using
    pronouns easier, by aiding in the identification
    of pronouns in a scentence - either for training
    ML models, knowing what the user is saying beyond
    keyword matching, etcetera.

    returns a tuple of matches for certain
