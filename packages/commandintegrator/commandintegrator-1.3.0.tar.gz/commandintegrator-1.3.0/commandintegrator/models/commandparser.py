Module details:
    
    The CommandParser object is a ready-to-use
    variant of the FeatureCommandParserBase class
    which is designed for inheritation. Using the
    CommandParser object enables developers to 
    use the default configuration of the CommandParser
    without writing a trivial inherit with only
    a constructor for child and parent class, allowing
    for two ways to develop with commandintegrator.

class CommandParser(FeatureCommandParserBase):
    """
    Class with attributes and methods from the base
    class FeatureCommandParserBase, to be used when
    no method overloading is desired by the developer.
