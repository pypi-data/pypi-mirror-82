Module details:
    
    The Feature object is a ready-to-use variant 
    of the FeatureBase class which is designed for 
    inheritation. Using the Feature object enables 
    developers to use the default configuration of 
    the Feature without writing a trivial inherit with only
    a constructor for child and parent class, allowing
    for two ways to develop with commandintegrator.
