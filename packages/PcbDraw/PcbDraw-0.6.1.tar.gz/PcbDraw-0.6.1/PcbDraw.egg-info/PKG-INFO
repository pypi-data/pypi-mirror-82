Description: # PcbDraw
        
        Convert your KiCAD boards into nice looking 2D drawings suitable for pinout
        diagrams. Never draw them manually again!
        
        ![example](promo_pcbdraw.png)
        
        This small Python script takes a KiCAD board (.kicad_pcb file) and produces a 2D
        nice looking drawing of the board as an SVG file. This allows you to quickly and
        automatically create awesome pinout diagrams for your project. These diagrams
        are much easier to read than a labeled photo of a physical board or an actual
        KiCAD design.
        
        You and your users will love them!
        
        PcbDraw also comes with a small utility called Populate which allows you to
        easily specify & maintain nice looking HTML or Markdown population manuals.

        ## Usage
        
        There are two separate guides:
        
        - [usage of PcbDraw](doc/pcbdraw.md)
        - [usage of Populate](doc/populate.md)
        
        There are also examples of usage in the `examples` directory.

        Feel free to submit issues and pull requests!
        
        ## Future Work
        
        - make reasonably complete module library
        - produce nicer SVG file structures (make SVG smaller by including each module
          exactly once, treat ids correctly,...)
        - support value labels on modules
