This page is a detailed guide for using ms3 for different tasks. It supposes you are working in an interactive Python
interpreter such as IPython, Jupyter, Google Colab, or just the console.


Good to know
============

Terminology
-----------

.. _mc_vs_mn:

Measure counts (MC) vs. measure numbers (MN)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Measure counts are strictly increasing numbers for all <measure> nodes in the score, regardless of their length. This
information is crucial for correctly addressing positions in a MuseScore file and are shown in the software's status
bar. The first measure is always counted as 1 (following MuseScore's convention), even if it is an anacrusis.

Measure numbers are the traditional way by which humans refer to positions in a score. They follow a couple of
conventions which can be summarised as counting complete bars. Quite often, a complete bar (MN) can be made up of
two <measure> nodes (MC). In the context of this library, score addressability needs to be maintained for humans and
computers, therefore a mapping MC -> MN is preserved in the score information DataFrames.

.. _quarter_beats:

Quarter Beats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A quarter beat always has the length of a quarter note. It is used as a standard unit to express positions and durations
independently of the beat size suggested by the :ref:`time signature <timesig>` (e.g. three eighths), and can be
:ref:`converted to a different beat size  <converting_quarter_beats>`.

If the guidelines say *"xy is expressed as/in quarter beats"*,
it **actually** means "as fractions of a whole note". So the duration of a half note, for example, is expressed
as ``1/2``, and not as ``2`` (which but be the multiplier of quarter beats, or understanding quarter beats as unit).
This is simply a terminological convention to speak consistently of beat sizes.

Using the library
=================

Parsing a single score
----------------------

.. rst-class:: bignums

1. Locate the `MuseScore 3 <https://musescore.org/en/download>`__ score you want to parse.

    Make sure it is uncompressed. i.e. it has the extension ``.mscx`` and not ``.mscz``.

    .. tip::

        MSCZ files are ZIP files containing the uncompressed MSCX. A later version of ms3 will be able to deal with MSCZ, too.


    In the examples, we parse the annotated first page of Giovanni
    Battista Pergolesi's influential *Stabat Mater*. The file is called ``stabat.mscx`` and can be downloaded from
    `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johentsch/ms3/master/docs/stabat.mscx>`__ (open link and key ``Ctrl + S`` to save the file
    or right-click on the link to ``Save link as...``).

2. Import the library.

    To parse a single score, we will use the class ``ms3.Score``. We could import the whole library:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import ms3
        >>> s = ms3.Score()

    or simply import the class:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from ms3 import Score
        >>> s = Score()

3. Create a ``ms3.Score`` object.

    In the example, the MuseScore 3 file is located at ``~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx`` so we can simply create the object
    and bind it to the variable ``s`` like so:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> from ms3 import Score
        >>> s = Score('~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx')

4. Inspect the object.

    To have a look at the created object we can simply evoke its variable:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> s
        MuseScore file
        --------------

        ~/ms3/docs/stabat.mscx

        Attached annotations

Column Names
============

General Columns
---------------

.. _mc:

**mc** Measure Counts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Measure count, identifier for the measure units in the XML encoding.
Always starts with 1 for correspondence to MuseScore's status bar.

.. _mn:

**mn** Measure Numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Measure number, continuous count of complete measures as used in printed editions.
Starts with 1 except for pieces beginning with a pickup measure, numbered as 0.

.. _onset:

**onsets**
^^^^^^^^^^
The value for ``onset`` represents, expressed as :ref:`quarter beats <quarter_beats>`, a position in a measure where ``0``
corresponds to the earliest possible position (in most cases beat 1), and some other fraction corresponds to an onset's offset from ``0``.
:ref:`Quarter beats <quarter_beats>` can be :ref:`converted to beats <converting_quarter_beats>`, e.g. to half beats or dotted eighth beats;
However, the operation may rely on the value of :ref:`mc_offset <mc_offset>`.

.. topic:: Developers

    When loading a table from a file, it is recommended to parse the text of this
    column with ``fractions.Fraction()`` to be able to calculate with the values.
    MS3 does this automatically.

Measures
--------

.. _act_dur:

**act_dur** Actual duration of a measure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of ``act_dur`` in most cases equals the time signature, expressed as a fraction; meaning for example that
a "normal" measure in 6/8 has ``act_dur = 3/4``. If the measure has an irregular length, for example a pickup measure
of length 1/8, would have ``act_dur = 1/8``.

The value of ``act_dur`` plays an important part in inferring :ref:`MNs <mn>`
from :ref:`MCs <mc>`. See also the columns :ref:`dont_count <dont_count>` and :ref:`numbering_offset <numbering_offset>`.

.. _barline:

**barline**
^^^^^^^^^^^

The column ``barline`` encodes information about the measure's final bar line.

.. _breaks:

**breaks**
^^^^^^^^^^

The column ``breaks`` may include three different values: ``{'line', 'page', 'section'}`` which represent the different
breaks types. In the case of section breaks, MuseScore

.. _dont_count:

**dont_count** Measures excluded from bar count
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a binary value that corresponds to MuseScore's setting ``Exclude from bar count`` from the ``Bar Properties`` menu.
The value is ``1`` for pickup bars, second :ref:`MCs <mc>` of divided :ref:`MNs <mn>` and some volta measures,
and ``NaN`` otherwise.

.. _keysig:

**keysig** Key Signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The feature ``keysig`` represents the key signature of a particular measure.
It is an integer which, if positive, represents the number of sharps, and if
negative, the number of flats. E.g.: ``3``: three sharps, ``-2``: two flats,
``0``: no accidentals.

.. _mc_offset:

**mc_offset** Offset of a MC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The column ``mc_offset`` , in most cases, has the value ``0`` because it expresses the deviation of this MC's
:ref:`onset <onset>` ``0`` (beginning of the MC)
from beat 1 of the corresponding MN. If the value is a fraction > 0, it means that this MC is part of a MN which is
composed of at least two MCs, and it expresses the current MC's offset in terms of the duration of all (usually 1) preceding MCs
which are also part of the corresponding MN. In the standard case that one MN would be split in two MCs, the first MC
would have mc_offset = ``0`` , and the second one mc_offset = ``the previous MC's`` :ref:`act_dur <act_dur>` .

.. _next:

**next**
^^^^^^^^

Every cell in this column has at least one integer, namely the MC of the subsequent bar, or ``-1`` in the cast of the last.
In the case of repetitions, measures can have more than one subsequent MCs, in which case the integers are separated by
``', '`` .

The column is used for checking whether :ref:`irregular measure lengths <act_dur>` even themselves out because otherwise
the inferred MNs might be wrong. Also, it is needed for MS3's unfold repeats functionality (TODO).

.. topic:: Developers

    Within MS3, the ``next`` column holds tuples, which MS3 should normally store as strings without paranthesis. For
    example, the tuple ``(17, 1)`` is stored as ``'17, 1'``. However, users might have extracted and stored a raw DataFrame
    from a :obj:`Score` object and MS3 needs to handle both formats.

.. _numbering_offset:

**numbering_offset** Offsetting MNs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MuseScore's measure number counter can be reset at a given MC by using the ``Add to bar number`` setting from the
``Bar Properties`` menu. If ``numbering_offset`` â‰  0, the counting offset is added to the current MN and all subsequent
MNs are inferred accordingly.

Scores which include several pieces (e.g. in variations or a suite),
sometimes, instead of using section :ref:`breaks <breaks>`, use ``numbering_offset`` to simulate a restart for counting
:ref:`MNs <mn>` at every new section. This leads to ambiguous MNs.



.. _repeats:

**repeats**
^^^^^^^^^^^

The column ``repeats`` indicates the presence of repeat signs and can have the values
``{'start', 'end', 'startend', 'firstMeasure', 'lastMeasure'}``. MS3 performs a test on the
repeat signs' plausibility and throws warnings when some inference is required for this.

The ``repeats`` column needs to have the correct repeat sign structure in order to have a correct :ref:`next <next>`
column which, in return, is required for MS3's unfolding repetitions functionality. (TODO)


.. _timesig:

**timesig** Time Signatures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time signature ``timesig`` of a particular measure is expressed as a string, e.g. ``'2/2'``.
The :ref:`actual duration <act_dur>` of a measure can deviate from the time signature for notational reasons: For example,
a pickup bar could have an actual duration of ``1/4``  but still be part of a ``'3/8'`` meter, which usually
has an actual duration of ``3/8``.

.. topic:: Developers

    When loading a table from a file, time signatures are not parsed as fractions because then both
    ``'2/2'`` and ``'4/4'``, for example, would become ``1``.

.. _volta:

**volta**
^^^^^^^^^

In the case of first and second (third etc.) endings, this column holds the number of every "bracket", "house", or *volta*,
which should increase from 1. This is required for MS3's unfold repeats function (TODO) to work.

The MNs for all voltas except those of the first one need to be amended to match those of the
first volta. In the case where these voltas have only one measure each, the :ref:`dont_count <dont_count>` option suffices. If
the voltas have more than one measure, the :ref:`numbering_offset <numbering_offset>` setting needs to be used.
