Description: 
        This library can run unit test of target package software.
        Supported languages are *python* (through z0testlib.py)
        and *bash* (through z0testrc)
        
        *zerobug* supports test automation, aggregation of tests into collections
        and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.
        The *zerobug* module provides all code that make it easy to support testing
        both for python programs both for bash scripts.
        *zerobug* differs from pytest standard library because show execution test with
        a message like "n/tot message" where *n* is current unit test and *tot* is the
        total unit test to execute, that is a sort of advancing test progress.
        
        *zerobug* is built on follow concepts:
        
        * test main - it is a main program to executes all test runners
        * test runner - it is a program to executes one or more test suites
        * test suite - it is a collection of test cases
        * test case -it is a smallest unit test
