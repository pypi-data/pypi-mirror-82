"""
Module for defining MPPT characteristic. Still at embryonic stage.
For controllers corresponding to the sunpump specs (i.e. with output voltage
up to 120V), check controller_files

# TODO: develop input_voltage_range attribute to ensure that it fits with
# the ouput voltage from PV array. (Will allow to reduce the computation time
# as well as pvpumpingsystem will not look for too big number of modules
# in the PVPS anymore)

# TODO: develop output_voltage_available attribute to ensure that it fits with
# the input voltage of the pump

# TODO: add way to have an efficiency depending on the input power
