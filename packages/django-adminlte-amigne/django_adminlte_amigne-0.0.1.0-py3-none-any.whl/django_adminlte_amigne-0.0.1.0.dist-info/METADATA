# django-adminlte
This package is an integration of the [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/)
template as a Django application.

It is intended to be a foundation for the generation of the base
template file of new Django project.

This project is currently in a very early development state: Please note
that defined {% block %} sections may change in further development
releases before reaching stability. Please consider this before adopting
this module for your own projects.

# Usage
The application must be added in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list within the
project settings file.
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   ...
    'adminlte',
]
```

It is a good practice to write a project `base.html` file that extends the
adminlte's application base template and define the fixed elements for the
project there.
```
{% extends "adminlte/base.html" %}
```

Please refer to the files `adminlte/base_template.html` and
`adminlte/base.html` to retrieve the block names. This will be documented
at a later stage, when the template will have reached stability.

The template requires the 
[django-menu-gauteron](https://pypi.org/project/django-menu-gauteron/)
package to dynamically generate the navigation menu.

## Demo
This package includes all demonstration/example files packaged with the
AdminLTE template. These examples have been "Django-ized".

These files can easily be tested by refering to the urls and menu files.

In the project settings file, add:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'adminlte',
]
```

In the project `urls.py`, include:
```
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('demo/', include('adminlte.demo.urls', namespace='adminlte-demo')),
]
```

In the project 'menu.py', include:
```
from django_menu import include

menu = [
    ...
    *include('adminlte.demo.menu'),
]
```

The demo files can be browsed using http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/ (if your 
server runs on 127.0.0.1:8000 and the configured path is `demo/`).

The example templates can be used as models to generate your own
project base template.

# Requirements
This package requires
  * Django 3.8 or above (not tested with below versions)
  * [django-menu-gauteron](https://pypi.org/project/django-menu-gauteron/)

# Contribution
Any contribution (code, requests, advices, ...) is very welcome. No project
is (or at least should be) a one-man show!

This modest project can get more ambitious thanks to your ideas.
