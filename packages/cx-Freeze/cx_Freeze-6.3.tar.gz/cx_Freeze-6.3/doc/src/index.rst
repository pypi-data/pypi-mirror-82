Welcome to cx_Freeze's documentation!
=====================================

**cx_Freeze** is a set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into
executables in much the same way that py2exe_ and py2app_ do. Unlike these two
tools, cx_Freeze is cross platform and should work on any platform that Python
itself works on. It supports Python_ 3.5.2 or higher.

If you need support for Python 2.x, cx\_Freeze version 5.1.x should be used
instead.

**cx_Freeze** is distributed under an open-source :ref:`license <license>` (the PSF license).
