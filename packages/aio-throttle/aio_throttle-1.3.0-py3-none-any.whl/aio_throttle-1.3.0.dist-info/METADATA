This library is inspired by [this book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/handling-overload/) and this implementation https://github.com/vostok/throttling.

Features:
1. Set capacity(max parallel requests) and queue(max queued requests) limits.
1. Per-consumer limits. For instance, to not allow any consumer to use more than 70% of service's capacity.
1. Per-request priorities. For instance, to not allow requests with lowest priority to be queued or to now allow requests with normal priority to use more than 90% of service's capacity. 

Example:
```python
from aio_throttle import Throttler, MaxFractionCapacityQuota, ThrottlePriority, ThrottleResult

capacity_limit = 100
queue_limit = 200
consumer_quotas = [MaxFractionCapacityQuota(0.7)]
priority_quotas = [MaxFractionCapacityQuota(0.9, ThrottlePriority.NORMAL)]
throttler = Throttler(capacity_limit, queue_limit, consumer_quotas, priority_quotas)

async with throttler.throttle(consumer, priority) as result:
    ... # check if result is ThrottleResult.ACCEPTED or not
```
