Pervane is a plain text file based note taking and knowledge base building tool.
It doubles as simple file server to render given directories files in web
browser while it can be used as a cloud IDE too with awesome code highlighting.
It's like python's built-in SimpleHTTPServer but a little bit feature richer
like WYSIWYG note taking experience, sidebar with infinite number of nesting,
blazing fast text search, file moving, creating from the browser etc.

Main use case is to create, edit, serve and search the markdown notes in
combination with example source files.

If you are using plain text based note taking, this can be helpful for adhoc
mediums like operating systems which don't have large desktop app ecosystem like
ChromeOS or mobile OS like Android and iOS.

## Features

* Completely private, your files, your computer, no database, no installation
  (apart from some general python packages).
* Self hosted (working on a managed version if anyone is interested, drop a messsage!)
* Notes are stored as plain text files with the names given by yourself. Pervane
  doesn't rename automatically.
* Extremely fast UI with quick note switches.
* Tabbed UI.
* No added metadata files etc. Just globs your files, caches for N seconds and
  creates the file tree.
* Source of truth is your own file system so you can use your favorite markdown
  editor to modify your notes: QOwnNotes, VSCode, Sublime Text etc.
* Ignore some files in order not to be shown on the sidebar.
* Flask based server, totally hackable, just modify, it's all yours.
* Minimal dependencies, single binary.
* Uses [silver searcher (ag)](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for
  searching in an instant throughout the whole folder.
* Thanks to ag, no indexing or prework is done for search. You can just start
  using Pervane with one line command.
* File tree with proper infinite number of nesting, works well for hierarchical
  note taking and knowledge base building.
* Cookie based authentication.
* No stats collection, all private.

* Find an replace within the editor.

## Install via pip

```shell
screen
pip install pervane
pervane --dir=example/
```

When you go to localhost:5000, you need to register. Pervane only accepts 1
