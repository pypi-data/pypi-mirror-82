<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nempy is an open-source python package that can be used to model the dispatch procedure of the Australian National
Electricity Market (NEM). We believe nempy will be a valuable tool for academic researchers and industry analysts
exploring a wide variety of questions. The dispatch process is at the core of many market modelling projects. As the
NEM evolves, constraints and ancillary service markets are becoming increasingly important in shaping dispatch outcomes.
Significant changes to the dispatch process are also likely to occur soon. Nempy allows users to easily configure a
dispatch model to fit the relevant research question. Furthermore, if extra functionality is needed, the python
implementation, open-source licencing and planned ongoing support from developers make it possible to adapt nempy
to your needs. The publication of this technical brief coincides with the release of nempy version 1.0.0. Version 1 will
be a stable release and ongoing minor updates or patches will remain backwards compatible. However, we are interested in
receiving feedback to inform the ongoing maintenance, development and any future major updates.</p>
<p>Nempy is feature rich, flexible, can recreate historical dispatch with a high degree of accuracy, runs fast, has detailed
documentation and has planned support up until mid-2023.</p>

<div class="section" id="flexibility">
<h2>Flexibility<a class="headerlink" href="#flexibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nempy is designed to have a high degree of flexibility, it can be used to implement very simple merit order dispatch models,
highly detailed models that seek to re-create the real world dispatch procedure, or a model at the many levels of intermediate
complexity. A set of examples demonstrating this flexibility are available on the package’s documentation
<a class="reference external" href="https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">readthedocs page</a>. Most inputs are passed to nempy as pandas DataFrame
objects, which means nempy can easily source inputs from other python code, SQL databases, CSVs and other formats supported by
the pandas’ interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accuracy">
<h2>Accuracy<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The accuracy with which nempy represents the NEM’s dispatch process can be measured by re-creating historical dispatch results.
This is done for a given dispatch interval by downloading the relevant historical inputs such as unit initial operating levels,
bids and generic constraints, processing these inputs so they are compatible with the nempy SpotMarket class, and finally
dispatching the spot market. The results can then be compared to historical results to gauge the model’s accuracy.
Figure 1 shows the results of this process for 1000 randomly selected dispatch intervals in 2019, comparing the modelled
NSW energy price with historical prices. Here the model is configured to maximally reflect the NEM’s dispatch procedure.
The code to produce the results shown in this figure is available <a class="reference external" href="https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publications.html#source-code-for-figure-1">here</a>.
Figure 2 shows a similar comparison, but without FCAS markets or generic constraints. The code to produce the results
shown in Figure 2 is available <a class="reference external" href="https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publications.html#source-code-for-figure-2">here</a>.
The simpler model produces a similar number of medianly priced intervals, however, outcomes for extreme ends of the price
duration curve differ significantly from historical values.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="run-time">
<h2>Run-time<a class="headerlink" href="#run-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The run-time for nempy to calculate dispatch depends on several factors, the complexity of the model implemented, time
taken to load inputs, the mixed-integer linear solver used and of course the hardware. Run-times reported here used an
Intel® Xeon(R) W-2145 CPU &#64; 3.70 GHz. For the model results shown in Figure 1, including time taken to load inputs from
the disk and using the open-source solver CBC, the average run-time per dispatch interval was 2.54 s. When the proprietary
solver Gurobi was used, a run-time of 1.84 s was achieved. For the results shown in Figure 2, the run-times with CBC and
Gurobi were 1.02 s and 0.98 s respectively, indicating that for simpler models the solver used has a smaller impact on
run-time. For the simpler model, the time to load inputs is increased significantly by the loading of historical NEMDE
input/output XML files which takes approximately 0.4 s. Importantly, this means it will be possible to speed up simpler
models by sourcing inputs from different data storage formats.</p>

<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nempy has a detailed set of documentation, mainly comprising of two types: examples and reference documentation. The
examples aim to show how nempy can be used and how it works in a practical manner. A number of simple examples focus on
demonstrating the use of subsets of the package’s features in isolation in order to make them easier to understand. The
more complex examples show how features can be combined to build models more suitable for analysis. The reference
documentation aims to cover all the package’s public APIs (the classes, methods and functions accessible to the user),
describing their use, inputs, outputs and any side effects. Find the documentation on our
<a class="reference external" href="https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">readthedocs page</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support">
<h2>Support<a class="headerlink" href="#support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nempy’s development is being led by Nick Gorman as part of his PhD candidature at the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental
Markets at the University of New South Wales’ School of Photovoltaics and Renewable Energy Engineering. As part of this
project we plan to engage with and support software users, this can be facilitated through the PhD until mid-2023. If
nempy is used sufficiently broadly we would look to continue support beyond this timeframe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ongoing-work">
<h2>Ongoing work<a class="headerlink" href="#ongoing-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ongoing work is likely to focus on greater support for time-sequential and dynamic models through the creation of tools
that dynamically create inputs for the dispatch process. This would likely include tools for dynamically generating
participant bids and regional FCAS requirements. Additionally, many historical dispatch generic constraints are potentially
unsuitable for dynamic modelling as their right-hand sides contain line flow values and unit operating statuses
that would be expected to change under many scenarios in a dynamic model. Thus, another avenue for future work is the
addition of tools for creating constraint inputs appropriate for dynamic modelling.</p>
