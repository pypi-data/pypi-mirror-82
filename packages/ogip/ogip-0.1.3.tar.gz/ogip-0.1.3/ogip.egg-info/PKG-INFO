Description: # Python library to read, write, and validate "OGIP" files
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/volodymyrss/ogip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/volodymyrss/ogip)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/volodymyrss/ogip/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/volodymyrss/ogip)
        
        
        
        * aims to support OGIP formats, especially [OGIP/92-007 (Spectral File Format)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/spectra/ogip_92_007/node5.html) and [OGIP Calibration Memo CAL/GEN/92-002](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/docs/memos/cal_gen_92_002/cal_gen_92_002.html)
        * does not aim to implement the strictest form of the standard, instead trying to understand the content from the least information provided, following [Postel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) [Law](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122) (which has proven to be successful in TCP). 
        * well-defined, versioned, and provenance-committed process
        * **it just works, always** while it is also **always possible to recover what exactly was done and why**.
        * relies only on [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
        
        Existing alternatives:
        
        * [heasoft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/) contains pyxpec and heasp modules, which read ogip files. 
        * [sherpa](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/sherpa/) and [3ml](https://github.com/threeML/threeML/) can read and write ogip files
        
        The alertnatives share common disadvantage: they are complex and not easily portable packages. 
        Also, they implement different variations of the standards, and we have a different aim here (see above).
        
        ## Disadvantages:
        
        * only python, hence slow
