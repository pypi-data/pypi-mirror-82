# CO2 monitoring with Prometheus

This reads from the CO2 Meter and makes it available as a Prometheus service.
The core logic comes from [this hackaday article](https://hackaday.io/project/5301-reverse-engineering-a-low-cost-usb-co-monitor/log/17909-all-your-base-are-belong-to-us).

## Setup

Note this assumes you are running on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (Buster)

1. Install Python 3
2. Install the monitor with `python3 -m pip install co2mini[homekit]` (remove `[homekit]` if you don't use HomeKit)
3. Set up CO2 udev rules by copying `90-co2mini.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-co2mini.rules`
4. Set up the service by copying `co2mini.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/co2mini.service`
5. Run `systemctl enable co2mini.service`
