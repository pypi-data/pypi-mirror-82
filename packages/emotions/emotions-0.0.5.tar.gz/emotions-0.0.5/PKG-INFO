        To use `emotions`, you need to have the package installed.
        
            $ sudo pip install emotions

        **Here are some set of commands to use it in Projects.** This module can be very effective for Projects like Personal assistants
        > - ```import emotions as aE```: For Importing the module as ```aE```.
        > - ```aE.emotion(ask)```:  Here ```ask=``` The word you want the **AI** to react to. Note that the **Mood** of AI is independent.
        > - ```aE.learn(input, emotion, url)```:  It is used to teach the **AI** about different **words** and our **feeling** about them. Here input refers to the **words**, emotion refers to the  **feeling** and `url` reffers to the *url* of the **Firebase Database**.  Once the **information** is stored it prints `'Got it!'`.Note that if your firebase database has no bucket `'/count'` it will **not work**. So first go ahead and create a `'/count'`  and store value `0` with tag `/1`
        > - To `print()` the out put, `print(aE.mood)`: to print the **Mood** and `print(aE.feelings)`: to print the **Emotion.**
