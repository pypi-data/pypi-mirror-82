        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cafeteria-simulation.
        
        ```bash
        pip install cafeteria-simulation
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The easiest simulation to perform
        
        ```python
        from cafe import Cafeteria, TOYOTA
        
        
        TIME = 300
        
        env = Cafeteria(TOYOTA.data, TIME)
        for _ in range(TIME):
            env.run([])
        
        # A graph showing the change in scores
        env.show()
        ```
        
        You can specify it by assigning the coordinates [table number, seat number] to run().
        
        Also, you can refer to the number of people in group_member up to 10 groups.
