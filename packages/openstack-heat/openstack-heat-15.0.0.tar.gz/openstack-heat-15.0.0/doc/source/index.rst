==================================
Welcome to the Heat documentation!
==================================
Heat is a service to orchestrate composite cloud applications
using a declarative template format through an OpenStack-native REST API.

Heat's purpose and vision
=========================

* Heat provides a template based orchestration for describing a cloud
  application by executing appropriate :term:`OpenStack` API calls to generate
  running cloud applications.
* A Heat template describes the infrastructure for a cloud application in text
  files which are readable and writable by humans, and can be managed by
  version control tools.
* Templates specify the relationships between resources (e.g. this
  volume is connected to this server). This enables Heat to call out to the
  OpenStack APIs to create all of your infrastructure in the correct order to
  completely launch your application.
* The software integrates other components of OpenStack. The templates allow
  creation of most OpenStack resource types (such as instances, floating ips,
  volumes, security groups, users, etc), as well as some more advanced
  functionality such as instance high availability, instance autoscaling, and
  nested stacks.
* Heat primarily manages infrastructure, but the templates
  integrate well with software configuration management tools such as Puppet
  and Ansible.
* Operators can customise the capabilities of Heat by installing plugins.

This documentation offers information aimed at end-users, operators and
developers of Heat.
