    The behavior of ``get_resource`` on an ``OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup``
    resource has changed. Previously it returned the physical resource name
    (i.e. the name of the nested Heat stack which implemented the group). It
    will now return the UUID of the nested stack if available. This will also
    apply to any resource type that inherits from
    ``OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup``.
