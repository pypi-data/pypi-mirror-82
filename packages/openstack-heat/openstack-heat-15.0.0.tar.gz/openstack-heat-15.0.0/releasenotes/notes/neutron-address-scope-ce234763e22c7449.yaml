    A new ``OS::Neutron:AddressScope`` resource that helps in
    managing the lifecycle of neutron address scope.
    Availability of this resource depends on availability of
    neutron ``address-scope`` API extension. This resource can
    be associated with multiple subnet pools in a one-to-many
    relationship. The subnet pools under an address scope must
    not overlap.
