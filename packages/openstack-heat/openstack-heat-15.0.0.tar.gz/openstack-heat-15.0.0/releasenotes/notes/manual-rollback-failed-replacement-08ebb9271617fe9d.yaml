    Heat can now perform a stack update to roll back to a previous version of a
    resource after a previous attempt to create a replacement for it failed
    (provided that convergence is enabled). This allows the user to recover a
    stack where a resource has been inadvertantly replaced with a definition
    than can never succeed because it conflicts with the original. Previously
    this required automatic rollback to be enabled, or the user had to update
    the stack with a non-conflicting definition before rolling back to the
    original.
