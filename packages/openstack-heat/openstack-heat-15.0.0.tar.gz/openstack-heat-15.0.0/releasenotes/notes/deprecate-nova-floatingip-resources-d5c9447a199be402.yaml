deprecations:
  - nova-network is no longer supported in OpenStack. Please use
    OS::Neutron::FloatingIPAssociation and OS::Neutron::FloatingIP in place of
    OS::Nova::FloatingIPAssociation and OS::Nova::FloatingIP
  - The AWS::EC2::EIP domain is always assumed to be 'vpc', since nova-network
    is not supported in OpenStack any longer.
