features:
  - A new property, deployment_swift_data is added to the OS::Nova::Server
    and OS::Heat::DeployedServer resources. The property is used to define
    the Swift container and object name that is used for deployment data
    for the server. If unset, the fallback is the previous behavior where
    these values will be automatically generated.
