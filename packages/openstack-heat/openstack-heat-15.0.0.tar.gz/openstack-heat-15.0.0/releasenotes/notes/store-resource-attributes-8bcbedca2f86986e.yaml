features:
  - Resource attributes are now stored at the time a resource is created or
    updated, allowing for fast resolution of outputs without having to retrieve
    live data from the underlying physical resource. To minimise compatibility
    problems, the behaviour of the `show` attribute, the `with_attr` option to
    the resource show API, and stacks that do not yet use the convergence
    architecture (due to the convergence_engine being disabled at the time they
    were created) is unchanged - in each of these cases live data will still be
    returned.
