    Heat now support policy in code, which means if you didn't modify any of
    policy rules, you won't need to add rules in the `policy.yaml` or
    `policy.json` file. Because from now, heat keeps all default policies under
    `heat/policies`. You can still generate and modify a `policy.yaml` file
    which will override policy rules in code if those rules appear in the
    `policy.yaml` file.

    Default policy.json file is now removed as we now generate the default
    policies in code. Please be aware that when using that file in your
    environment. You still can generate a `policy.yaml` file if that's required
    in your environment.
