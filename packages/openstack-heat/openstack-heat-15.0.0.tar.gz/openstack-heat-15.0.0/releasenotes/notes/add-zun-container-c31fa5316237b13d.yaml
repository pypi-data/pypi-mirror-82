    A new OS::Zun::Container resource is added that allows users to manage
    docker containers powered by Zun. This resource will have an 'addresses'
    attribute that contains various networking information including the
    neutron port id. This allows users to orchestrate containers with other
    networking resources (i.e. floating ip).
