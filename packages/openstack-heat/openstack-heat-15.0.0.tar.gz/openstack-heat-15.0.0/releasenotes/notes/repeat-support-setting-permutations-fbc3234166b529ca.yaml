features:
  - Added new section ``permutations`` for ``repeat`` function, to decide
    whether to iterate nested the over all the permutations of the elements
    in the given lists. If 'permutations' is not specified, we set the default
    value to true to compatible with before behavior. The args have to be lists
    instead of dicts if 'permutations' is False because keys in a dict are
    unordered, and the list args all have to be of the same length.
