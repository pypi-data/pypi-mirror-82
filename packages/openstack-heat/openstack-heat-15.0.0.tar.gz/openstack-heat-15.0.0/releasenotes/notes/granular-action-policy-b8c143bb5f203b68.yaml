    Operators can now apply different authorization policies to each action
    supported by the action API (``actions:suspend`` for suspend,
    ``actions:resume`` for resume, ``actions:check`` for check,
    ``actions:cancel_update`` for cancel operation and roll back, and
    ``actions:cancel_without_rollback`` for cancel operation without rolling
    back). The default for each is to use the existing ``actions:action`` rule
    that was previously the only way to specify policy for actions.
