features:
  - New item key 'allocate_network' of 'networks' with allowed values 'auto'
    and 'none' for OS::Nova::Server, to support 'Give Me a Network' nova feature.
    Specifying 'auto' would auto allocate a network topology for the project
    if there is no existing network available; Specifying 'none' means no
    networking will be allocated for the created server.
    This feature requires nova API micro version 2.37 or later and
    the ``auto-allocated-topology`` API is available in the Neutron
    networking service.
