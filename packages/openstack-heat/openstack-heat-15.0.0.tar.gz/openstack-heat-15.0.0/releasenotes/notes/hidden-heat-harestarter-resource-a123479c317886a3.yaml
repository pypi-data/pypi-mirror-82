    The ``OS::Heat::HARestarter`` resource type is no longer supported. This
    resource type is now hidden from the documentation. HARestarter resources
    in stacks, including pre-existing ones, are now only placeholders and will
    no longer do anything. The recommended alternative is to mark a resource
    unhealthy and then do a stack update to replace it. This still correctly
    manages dependencies but, unlike HARestarter, also avoid replacing
    dependent resources unnecessarily. An example of this technique can be
    seen in the autohealing sample templates at
    https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/heat-templates/tree/hot/autohealing
