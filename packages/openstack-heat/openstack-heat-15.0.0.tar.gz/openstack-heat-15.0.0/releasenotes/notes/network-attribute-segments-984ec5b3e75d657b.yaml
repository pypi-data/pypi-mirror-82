    Adds a new attribute ``segments`` to the ``OS::Neutron::Net`` resource.
    The attribute resolves the network segments on the network.  The attribute
    is useful when migrating from a non routed provider network to a routed
    provider network. The example below show how to migrate an existing subnet
    to one that is associated with the segment::

      TestSubnet:
        type: OS::Neutron::Subnet
        name: the_subnet
        properties:
          segment: {get_attr: [the_network, segments, 0, id]}
