    Previously, the suspend, resume, and check API calls for all stacks, and
    the update, restore, and delete API calls for non-convergence stacks,
    returned immediately after starting the stack operation. This meant that
    for a client reading the state immediately when performing the same
    operation twice in a row, it could have misinterpreted a previous state as
    the latest unless careful reference were made to the updated_at timestamp.
    Stacks are now guaranteed to have moved to the ``IN_PROGRESS`` state before
    any of these APIs return (except in the case of deleting a non-convergence
    stack where another operation was already in progress).
