fixes:
  - Force delete the nova instance.
    If a resource is related with a nova instance which
    is in 'SOFT_DELETED' status, the resource can't be
    deleted, when nova config 'reclaim_instance_interval'.
    so, force-delete the nova instance, and then all the
    resources are related with the instance would be
    processed properly.
