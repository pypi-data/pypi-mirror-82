    Designate project had removed v1 api support since stable/queens.
    Heat has now removed support for v1 resources ``OS::Designate::Domain``
    and ``OS::Designate::Record`` completely and replaced them with
    placeholders for existing templates with those resources. The
    ``designate.domain`` custom constraint has also been removed.
