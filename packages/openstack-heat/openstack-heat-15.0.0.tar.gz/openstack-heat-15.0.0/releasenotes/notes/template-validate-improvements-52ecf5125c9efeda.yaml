  - Template validation is improved to ignore the given set of error codes. For
    example, heat will report template as invalid one, if it does not find any
    required OpenStack services in the cloud deployment and while authoring
    the template, user might wants to avoid such scenarios, so that (s)he could
    create valid template without bothering about run-time environments. Please
    refer the API documentation of validate template for more details.
