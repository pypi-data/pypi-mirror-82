    Note that Heat is compatible with OpenStack Identity federation, even when
    using Keystone trusts. It should work after you enable Federation and build
    the `auto-provisioning map`_ with the heat service user in Keystone.
    Auto-provisioning has been available in Keystone since the Ocata release.

    The Heat plugin in Horizon has been replaced with a new stand-alone
    Horizon plugin, heat-dashboard. You can see more detail in the
    heat-dashboard repository
    (https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/heat-dashboard).

    The old Heat Tempest plugin ``heat_tests`` has been removed and replaced
    by a separate Tempest plugin named ``heat``, in the heat-tempest-plugin
    repository (https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/heat-tempest-plugin).
    Functional tests that are appropriate for the Tempest environment have been
    migrated to the new plugin. Other functional tests remain behind in the
    heat repository.
