critical:
  - Since Aodh drop support for combination alarm, therefore
    OS::Aodh::CombinationAlarm is now mark as hidden resource with
    directly inheriting from None resource which will make the
    resource do nothing when handling any actions (other than delete).
    And please don't use it. Old resource which created with that
    resource type still able to delete. It's recommand to switch
    that resource type ASAP, since we will remove that resource
    soon.
