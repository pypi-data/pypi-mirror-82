    Passwords generated by the OS::Heat::RandomString resource may have had
    less entropy than expected, depending on what is specified in the
    ``character_class`` and ``character_sequence`` properties. This has been
    corrected so that each character present in any of the specified classes
    or sequences now has an equal probability of appearing at each point in
    the generated random string.
