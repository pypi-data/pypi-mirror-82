    Added a new config option server_keystone_endpoint_type to specify
    the keystone authentication endpoint (public/internal/admin)
    to pass into cloud-init data.
    If left unset the original behavior should remain unchanged.

    This feature allows the deployer to unambiguously specify the
    keystone endpoint passed to user provisioned servers, and is particularly
    useful where the deployment network architecture requires the heat
    service to interact with the internal endpoint,
    but user provisioned servers only have access to the external network.
