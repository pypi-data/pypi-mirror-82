features:

    Added new config option ``[DEFAULT]allow_trusts_redelegation`` (``False``
    by default). When enabled and ``reauthentication_auth_method`` is set to
    ``trusts``, Heat will always create trusts with enabled redelegation,
    for both trusts used for long running stacks and for trusts used for
    deferred authentication.
security:
  - |
    With both ``reauthentication_auth_method`` set to ``trusts`` and
    ``allow_trusts_redelegation`` set to ``True`` (new config option, ``False``
    by default), Heat will always create trusts with enabled redelegation,
    for both trusts used for long running stacks and for trusts used for
    deferred authentication. This have security implications and is only
    recommended when Heat is set to use trust and you experience problems
    with other services Heat consumes that also require to create trusts
    from token being passed by Heat (examples are Aodh and Heat running in
    another region).
