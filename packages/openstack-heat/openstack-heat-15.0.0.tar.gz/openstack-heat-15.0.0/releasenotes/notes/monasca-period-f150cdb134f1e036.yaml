  - Add optional 'period' property for Monasca Notification resource. The new
    added property will now allow the user to tell Monasca the interval in
    seconds to periodically invoke a webhook until the ALARM state transitions
    back to an OK state or vice versa. This is useful when the user wants to
    create a stack which will automatically scale up or scale down more than
    once if the alarm state continues to be in the same state.  To conform to
    the existing Heat autoscaling behaviour, we manually create the monasca
    notification resource in Heat with a default interval value of 60.
