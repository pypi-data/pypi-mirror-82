  - Intrinsic function plugins will now be passed a StackDefinition object
    instead of a Stack object. When accessing resources, the StackDefinition
    will return ResourceProxy objects instead of Resource objects. These
    classes replicate the parts of the Stack and Resource APIs that are used by
    the built-in Function plugins, but authors of custom third-party
    Template/Function plugins should audit them to ensure they do not depend on
    unstable parts of the API that are no longer accessible. The
    StackDefinition and ResourceProxy APIs are considered stable and any future
    changes to them will go through the standard deprecation process.
