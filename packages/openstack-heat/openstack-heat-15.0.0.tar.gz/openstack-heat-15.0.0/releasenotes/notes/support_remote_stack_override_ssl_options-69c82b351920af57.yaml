    Add ``ca_cert`` and ``insecure`` properties for
    ``OS::Heat::Stack`` resource type. The ``ca_cert`` is the contents of a CA
    Certificate file that can be used to verify a remote cloud or region's
    server certificate. ``insecure`` is boolean option, CA cert will be use if
    we didn't setup insecure flag.
