# Smallparts

A humble collection of convenience modules for use with Python 3

This package mainly focuses on text conversion and generation.

When coding in Python, I found myself copying the same modules into my
projects over and over again, doing a few changes here and there and
ended up with slightly different modules with the same functionality.
So one day I decided to put an end to that and transfer my frequently used
helper modules to a single source of truth.  
Here they are, in good hope that they might be useful to others as well.
