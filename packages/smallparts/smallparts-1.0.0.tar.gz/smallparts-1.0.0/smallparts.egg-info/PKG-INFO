Description: # Smallparts
        
        A humble collection of convenience modules for use with Python 3
        
        This package mainly focuses on text conversion and generation.
        
        When coding in Python, I found myself copying the same modules into my
        projects over and over again, doing a few changes here and there and
        ended up with slightly different modules with the same functionality.
        So one day I decided to put an end to that and transfer my frequently used
        helper modules to a single source of truth.  
        Here they are, in good hope that they might be useful to others as well.
