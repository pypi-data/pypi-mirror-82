Installation
============

**CarveMe** currently supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.6, which are available for all major operating systems. We recommend the `Anaconda python
distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

It can be easily installed using the **pip** package manager:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install carveme

This will automatically install other dependencies as well:

- framed_
- pandas_

.. _framed: https://github.com/cdanielmachado/framed
.. _pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/

Additionally, you must manually install two external dependencies:

- diamond_
- IBM CPLEX_ Optimizer

.. _diamond: https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond
.. _CPLEX: https://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/

Note that you will need to register with IBM to obtain an academic license for CPLEX.

Also, after installing CPLEX, do not forget to install the CPLEX python API (see the CPLEX documentation_ for details).

.. _documentation: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.7.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html

After installation you should run the initialization script to update the internal data files:

.. code-block:: console

    $ carveme_init

Everything should be ready now! See the next section for instructions on how to start *carving*.
