## Why is the main branch called approved?

As the major version numbers increment the policy for the default "approved" branch differs.  Consider 1.x to be internal develpment with approved being highly volatile.  The 2.x series is the beta testing/qa version and 3.x being the first stable version.  This comes from a software development addage that v1.0 is released too fast, v2.0 is what v1.0 should have been and v3.0 is the first real version.

All participants in the eco-system can simply clone the reposity and run the python code in the approved branch.  Development/testing will be performed in seperate branches and merged into approved with the changes are ready to go live.
