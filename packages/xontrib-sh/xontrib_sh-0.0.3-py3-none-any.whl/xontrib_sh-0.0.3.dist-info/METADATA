## Install
```bash
xpip install -U xontrib-sh
echo 'xontrib load sh' >> ~/.xonshrc
# Reload xonsh
```

## Usage

Start a line with an exclamation point — `!` — then paste the sh-compatible commands 
after it and run. The command syntax will be tested in installed shells (bash, zsh, fish, sh) 
and the commands will be run in the first matching shell.

The commands will be executed in the environment that will be inherited from current
but if the commands modify the environment there will no changes in source xonsh environment.

## Example

### One line: brace expansion (bash syntax)
```bash
! echo 01.{05..10}
``` 
```
bash:
01.05 01.06 01.07 01.08 01.09 01.10
```

### Many lines: for loop (zsh syntax)
```zsh
! for x (1 2 3); do 
  echo $x; 
done

for x (4 5 6); do 
  echo $x; 
done
```
```
zsh:
1
2
3
4
5
6
```
