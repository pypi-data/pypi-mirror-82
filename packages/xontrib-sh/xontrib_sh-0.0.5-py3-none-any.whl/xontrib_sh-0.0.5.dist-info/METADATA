## Install
```bash
xpip install -U xontrib-sh
echo 'xontrib load sh' >> ~/.xonshrc
# Reload xonsh
```

## Usage

Start a line with an exclamation point — `!` — then paste the sh-compatible commands 
after it and run. The command syntax will be tested in installed shells (bash, zsh, fish, sh) 
and the commands will be run in the first matching shell.

The commands will be executed in the environment that will be inherited from current
but if the commands modify the environment there will no changes in source xonsh environment.

**Note!** The syntax checking is not determine the shell exactly right and pull requests are welcome!
The short commands may be determined as bash commands but it's fish or zsh.
As result the command will be failed. Use this carefully and if you know that you need only bash 
just remove the zsh and fish from the list as described below.

## Use cases

### The main use case

The main use case of `xontrib-sh` is when you copy and paste the sh-commands from some article or instruction 
and this commands are environment agnostic and you want to run it without rewriting it on xonsh or run sh-shell. 

For example you've found [xxh local](https://github.com/xxh/xxh#using-xxh-inplace-without-ssh-connection) snippet:
```bash
XH=~/.xxh \
 && XD=https://github.com/xxh/xxh-portable/raw/master/result/xxh-portable-musl-alpine-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
 && mkdir -p $XH && cd $XH \
 && ( [[ -x $(command -v curl) ]] && curl -L $XD || wget -O- $XD ) | tar zxf - xxh \
 && echo 'Usage: ./xxh local [+s xonsh/zsh/fish/osquery/bash]'
```

It's bash and it's environment agnostic and you hesitate how xonsh will execute this. Just start with `!` and 
paste this commands. As result you've installed `xxh local` and stayed in xonsh.

### One line: brace expansion (bash syntax)
```bash
! echo 01.{05..10}
``` 
```
bash:
01.05 01.06 01.07 01.08 01.09 01.10
```

### Many lines: for loop (zsh syntax)
```zsh
! for x (1 2 3); do 
  echo $x; 
done

for x (4 5 6); do 
  echo $x; 
done
```
```
zsh:
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

### Set certain shell for any commands
```python
$XONTRIB_SH_SHELLS = ['bash']
```
