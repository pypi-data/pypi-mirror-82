deprecations:
  - |
    FWaaS v1 extensions (`fwaas` and `fwaasrouterinsertion`) have been
    removed.  The functionality has always been experimental and
    has been marked deprecated since Liberty.

    Logging Resource extension (`logging-resource`) has also been removed
    because it's only useful with FWaaS v1.

    Unfortunately, no upgrade path is currently available for the existing
    deployments with those extensions.
