# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
pbr!=2.1.0,>=2.0.0 # Apache-2.0

Babel!=2.4.0,>=2.3.4 # BSD
neutron-lib>=1.18.0 # Apache-2.0

# midonet repository.

# OpenStack CI will install the following projects from git
# if they are in the required-projects list for a job:
neutron>=13.0.0.0b1 # Apache-2.0

# The comment below indicates this project repo is current with neutron-lib
# and should receive neutron-lib consumption patches as they are released
# in neutron-lib. It also implies the project will stay current with TC
# and infra initiatives ensuring consumption patches can land.
