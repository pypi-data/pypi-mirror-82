The subdirectories in this path are used to create sample csar zip
files to run the upload of VNF package and the VNF LCM instantiate.

The creation is manual, so run the following command:

    zip -r sample_vnf_pkg.zip TOSCA-Metadata Definitions Files

Requires the zip command. If it is not installed, you need to
install it in your environment.
