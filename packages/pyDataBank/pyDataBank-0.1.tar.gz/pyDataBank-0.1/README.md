# pyDataIP
Import resource files by selecting them one by one or in a batch with regex or with open dialog window
Associate these files or filesets to a key for an easy call

An example of use of both classes is shown below:

    resources = DataFiles(datafiles_settings)
    datapack = resources.generateDataPack()
    files_as_dict = datapack.getFileDict()
    fileset_as_dict = datapack.getFilesetDict()
    all_files_as_list = datapack.getFileList()


Where two examples of datafiles_settings given as a yml file are shown below:

Example1

    files:
        parent:
            tip: 'select your jpg file'
            type: 'jpg"
        depth: -1
        caseSensitive: true
        file1: 'fi.*_1\.txt'
        file2: 'file2'
    fileset:
        parent: "C:/folder2"
        depth: 0
        caseSensitive: true
        texts_set: '.*\.txt'
        images_set2: .*\.(jpg|png|tif|tiff)

Example2

    dialogs:
        image:
            tip: 'provide image file'
            type: 'png'
            set: true           # default value is True
        text:
            tip: 'provide txt file'
            type: 'txt'
            set: false
            
The resulting loaded resources due to the "files" section could be:

    files_as_dict = {'file1': 'path/to/file_1.txt', 'file2': 'path/to/myfile2.txt}
    fileset_as_dict = {'texts_set': ['mydoc.txt'], 'images_set2': ['image1.png', 'image2.jpg']}

And the dialogs settings pops open a dialog box xhich creates a fileset for 'image' and a file dictionary for 'text'

## DataFiles class
The DataFiles class manages resource files thanks to 2 dictionaries (files and fileset), one is a key/value per file, 
the other one is a key/value per file set (a group of files)

The way resource files are retrieved is based on regex. It uses Finder class of [pyFileFinder](https://pypi.org/project/pyFileFinder/) module to do so.
It is also possible to request the pop up of an open dialog box to select files. 


generateDataPack method returns a DataPack object. DataPack will be discussed in the next section.

See more example in the [test class](https://github.com/20centcroak/pyDataBank/blob/main/tests/unit/test_datafiles.py)

## DataPack class
The DataPack class is a container for 2 types of data: file paths and fileset paths.
    It manages 2 dictionaries.
    The first one is {name: path} with name as a short name for the file and path the file path
    The second one is {name: [paths]} with name as a short name for the fileset and [paths] the list of file paths
    Then it allows calling files by their shortname or get a list of all files referenced in the 2 dictionaries.

It offers convenient methods to 
- add files or filesets with or without a short name for these resources. A unique short name is always given to added resources.
- get files, fileset or the list of all files either contained in files or in fileset
