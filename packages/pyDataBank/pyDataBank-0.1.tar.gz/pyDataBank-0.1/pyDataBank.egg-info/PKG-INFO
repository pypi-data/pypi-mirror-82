Description: # pyDataIP
        Import resource files by selecting them one by one or in a batch with regex or with open dialog window
        Associate these files or filesets to a key for an easy call
        
        An example of use of both classes is shown below:
        
            resources = DataFiles(datafiles_settings)
            datapack = resources.generateDataPack()
            files_as_dict = datapack.getFileDict()
            fileset_as_dict = datapack.getFilesetDict()
            all_files_as_list = datapack.getFileList()
        
        
        Where two examples of datafiles_settings given as a yml file are shown below:
        
        Example1
        
            files:
                parent:
                    tip: 'select your jpg file'
                    type: 'jpg"
                depth: -1
                caseSensitive: true
                file1: 'fi.*_1\.txt'
                file2: 'file2'
            fileset:
                parent: "C:/folder2"
                depth: 0
                caseSensitive: true
                texts_set: '.*\.txt'
                images_set2: .*\.(jpg|png|tif|tiff)
        
        Example2
        
            dialogs:
                image:
                    tip: 'provide image file'
                    type: 'png'
                    set: true           # default value is True
                text:
                    tip: 'provide txt file'
                    type: 'txt'
                    set: false
                    
        The resulting loaded resources due to the "files" section could be:
        
            files_as_dict = {'file1': 'path/to/file_1.txt', 'file2': 'path/to/myfile2.txt}
            fileset_as_dict = {'texts_set': ['mydoc.txt'], 'images_set2': ['image1.png', 'image2.jpg']}
        
        And the dialogs settings pops open a dialog box xhich creates a fileset for 'image' and a file dictionary for 'text'
        
        ## DataFiles class
        The DataFiles class manages resource files thanks to 2 dictionaries (files and fileset), one is a key/value per file, 
        the other one is a key/value per file set (a group of files)
        
        The way resource files are retrieved is based on regex. It uses Finder class of [pyFileFinder](https://pypi.org/project/pyFileFinder/) module to do so.
        It is also possible to request the pop up of an open dialog box to select files. 
        
        
        generateDataPack method returns a DataPack object. DataPack will be discussed in the next section.
        
        See more example in the [test class](https://github.com/20centcroak/pyDataBank/blob/main/tests/unit/test_datafiles.py)
        
        ## DataPack class
        The DataPack class is a container for 2 types of data: file paths and fileset paths.
            It manages 2 dictionaries.
            The first one is {name: path} with name as a short name for the file and path the file path
            The second one is {name: [paths]} with name as a short name for the fileset and [paths] the list of file paths
            Then it allows calling files by their shortname or get a list of all files referenced in the 2 dictionaries.
        
        It offers convenient methods to 
        - add files or filesets with or without a short name for these resources. A unique short name is always given to added resources.
        - get files, fileset or the list of all files either contained in files or in fileset
