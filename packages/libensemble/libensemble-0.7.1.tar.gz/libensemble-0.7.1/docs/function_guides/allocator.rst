Allocation Functions
====================

Although the included allocation functions, or ``alloc_f``'s are sufficient for
most users, those who want to fine-tune how data is passed to their ``gen_f``
and ``sim_f`` can write their own. The ``alloc_f`` is unique since it is called
by the libEnsemble's manager instead of a worker.

Most ``alloc_f`` function definitions written by users resemble::

    def my_allocator(W, H, sim_specs, gen_specs, alloc_specs, persis_info):

Where :doc:`W<../data_structures/worker_array>` is an array containing information
about each worker's state, and ``H`` is the *trimmed* History array,
containing rows initialized by the generator.

Inside an ``alloc_f``, a :doc:`Work dictionary<../data_structures/work_dict>` is
instantiated::

    Work = {}

then populated with integer keys ``i`` for each worker and dictionary values to
give to those workers. An example Work dictionary from a run of
the ``test_1d_sampling.py`` regression test resembles::

    {
        1: {
            'H_fields': ['x'],
            'persis_info': {'rand_stream': RandomState(...) at ..., 'worker_num': 1},
            'tag': 1,
            'libE_info': {'H_rows': array([368])}
        },

        2: {
            'H_fields': ['x'],
            'persis_info': {'rand_stream': RandomState(...) at ..., 'worker_num': 2},
            'tag': 1,
            'libE_info': {'H_rows': array([369])}
        },

        3: {
            'H_fields': ['x'],
            'persis_info': {'rand_stream': RandomState(...) at ..., 'worker_num': 3},
            'tag': 1,
            'libE_info': {'H_rows': array([370])}
        },

        4: {
            'H_fields': ['x'],
            'persis_info': {'rand_stream': RandomState(...) at ..., 'worker_num': 4},
            'tag': 1,
            'libE_info': {'H_rows': array([371])}
        }
    }

Based on information from the API reference above, this Work dictionary
describes instructions for each of the four workers to call the ``sim_f``
with data from the ``'x'`` field and a given ``'H_row'`` from the
History array, and also pass ``persis_info``.

Constructing these arrays and determining which workers are available
for receiving data is simplified by several functions available within the
``libensemble.tools.alloc_support`` module:

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: avail_worker_ids

Many ``alloc_f`` routines loop over the available workers returned by the above
function to construct their Work dictionaries with the help of the following two
functions.

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: sim_work

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: gen_work

Note that these two functions *append* an entry in-place to the Work dictionary
and additional parameters are appended to ``libE_info``.

In practice, the structure of many allocation functions resemble::

    Work = {}
    ...
    for ID in avail_worker_ids(W):
        ...
        if some_condition:
            sim_work(Work, ID, chosen_H_fields, chosen_H_rows, persis_info)
            ...

        if another_condition:
            gen_work(Work, ID, chosen_H_fields, chosen_H_rows, persis_info)
            ...

    return Work, persis_info

The Work dictionary is returned to the manager with ``persis_info``. If ``1``
is returned as third value, this instructs the run to stop.

.. note:: An error occurs when the ``alloc_f`` returns nothing while
          all workers are idle

The final three functions available in the ``alloc_support`` module
are primarily for evaluating running generators:

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: test_any_gen

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: count_gens

.. currentmodule:: libensemble.tools.alloc_support
.. autofunction:: count_persis_gens

Descriptions of included allocation functions can be found :doc:`here<../examples/alloc_funcs>`.
The default allocation function used by libEnsemble if one isn't specified is
``give_sim_work_first``. During its worker ID loop, it checks if there's unallocated
work and assigns simulations for that work if so. Otherwise, it initializes
generators for up to ``'num_active_gens'`` instances. Other settings like
``batch_mode`` and blocking of non-active workers is also supported. See
:ref:`here<gswf_label>` for more information about ``give_sim_work_first``.

For a shorter, simpler example, here is the ``fast_alloc`` allocation function:

..  literalinclude:: ../../libensemble/alloc_funcs/fast_alloc.py
    :caption: /libensemble/alloc_funcs/fast_alloc.py
