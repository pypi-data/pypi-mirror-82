Description: # Getting started
        
        This Api is meant for 3rd party integrations
        
        ## How to Build
        
        
        You must have Python ```2 >=2.7.9``` or Python ```3 >=3.4``` installed on your system to install and run this SDK. This SDK package depends on other Python packages like nose, jsonpickle etc. 
        These dependencies are defined in the ```requirements.txt``` file that comes with the SDK.
        To resolve these dependencies, you can use the PIP Dependency manager. Install it by following steps at [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
        
        Python and PIP executables should be defined in your PATH. Open command prompt and type ```pip --version```.
        This should display the version of the PIP Dependency Manager installed if your installation was successful and the paths are properly defined.
        
        * Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including ```requirements.txt```) for the SDK.
        * Run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This should install all the required dependencies.

        ## How to Use
        
        The following section explains how to use the CynSmsPythonPackage SDK package in a new project.
        
        ### 1. Open Project in an IDE
        
        Open up a Python IDE like PyCharm. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.
        
        ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=pyCharm)
        
        Click on ```Open``` in PyCharm to browse to your generated SDK directory and then click ```OK```.
        
        ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject0&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python)     
        
        The project files will be displayed in the side bar as follows:
        
        ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject1&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python&projectName=cyn_sms_python_package)     
        
        ### 2. Add a new Test Project
        
        Create a new directory by right clicking on the solution name as shown below:
        
        ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createDirectory&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python&projectName=cyn_sms_python_package)
        
        Name the directory as "test"
        
        ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameDirectory)
           
        Add a python file to this project with the name "testsdk"
        
        ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createFile&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python&projectName=cyn_sms_python_package)
        
        Name it "testsdk"
        
        ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameFile)
        
        In your python file you will be required to import the generated python library using the following code lines
        
        ```Python
        from cyn_sms_python_package.cyn_sms_python_package_client import CynSmsPythonPackageClient
        ```
        
        ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=projectFiles&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python&libraryName=cyn_sms_python_package.cyn_sms_python_package_client&projectName=cyn_sms_python_package&className=CynSmsPythonPackageClient)
        
        After this you can write code to instantiate an API client object, get a controller object and  make API calls. Sample code is given in the subsequent sections.
        
        ### 3. Run the Test Project
        
        To run the file within your test project, right click on your Python file inside your Test project and click on ```Run```
        
        ![Run Test Project - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=CynSMS%20API-Python&libraryName=cyn_sms_python_package.cyn_sms_python_package_client&projectName=cyn_sms_python_package&className=CynSmsPythonPackageClient)
        
        
        ## How to Test
        
        You can test the generated SDK and the server with automatically generated test
        cases. unittest is used as the testing framework and nose is used as the test
        runner. You can run the tests as follows:
        
          1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
          2. Invoke ```pip install -r test-requirements.txt```
          3. Invoke ```nosetests```
        
        ## Initialization
        
        ### 
        
        API client can be initialized as following.
        
        ```python
        
        client = CynSmsPythonPackageClient()
        ```
