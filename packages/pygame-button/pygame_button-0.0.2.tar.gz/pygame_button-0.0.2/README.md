# pygame_button
A very simple button class for pygame.
Supports different background and font colors for idle, hover, and clicked modes. Can be linked to a function and set to either run on down-click, or click release.

It is stylable to a degree (see example). The easiest way to do this is to create a style dictionary and then pass this with the **kwarg unpacking syntax.

Many things that could still be added.

## Installation
``` sh
pip install pygame_button
```

## Usage
See [example](https://github.com/Layerex/pygame_button/blob/master/example/example.py)
