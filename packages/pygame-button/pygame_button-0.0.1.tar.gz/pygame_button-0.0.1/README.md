# pygame_button
A very simple button class for pygame.
Supports different background and font colors for idle, hover, and clicked modes. Can be linked to a function and set to either run on down-click, or click release.

It is stylable to a degree (see example). The easiest way to do this is to create a style dictionary and then pass this with the **kwarg unpacking syntax.

Many things that could still be added.
