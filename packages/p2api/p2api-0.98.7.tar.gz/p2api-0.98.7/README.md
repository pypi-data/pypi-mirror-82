The [ESO](https://www.eso.org/public/) [Phase 2](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase2.html) Application Programming Interface (API) uses the lightweight [JSON](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>) standard as data format to exchange information between your application and the Phase 2 server at ESO. In order to program more conveniently against the API, it is helpful to create small, [language-specific bindings](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding>) to the API. We provide a simple example binding for Python, i.e. p2api.

Now (as of version 0.97.2) with support for La Silla.

Please see the [ESO-USD p2api](<http://eso.org/sci/observing/phase2/p2intro/Phase2API.html>) page for more details.
