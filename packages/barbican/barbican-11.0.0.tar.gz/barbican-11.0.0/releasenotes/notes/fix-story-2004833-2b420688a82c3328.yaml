    Fixed Story #2004734: Added a new option 'hmac_keywrap_mechanism' to make
    the mechanism used to calculate a HMAC from an wrapped PKEK configurable.
    This was introduced because of an problem with Utimaco HSMs which throw an
    'CKR_MECHANISM_INVALID' error, e.g. when a new PKEK is generated. For
    Utimaco HSMs, 'hmac_keywrap_mechanism' should be set to 'CKM_AES_MAC' in
    barbican.conf.
