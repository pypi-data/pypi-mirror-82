    It is now possible for barbican-keystone-listener to listen on the same
    standard notification topic without interfering with other services by
    using the notification listener pools feature of oslo.messaging.
    To use it, set the new ``[keystone_notifications]pool_name`` option
    to some unique value (but the same for all instances of
    barbican-keystone-listener service).
    This feature is available only for those messaging transports of
    oslo.messaging that support it.
    At the moment those are rabbitmq and kafka.
    For more details see
    `oslo.messagind docs <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.messaging/latest/reference/notification_listener.html>`_
