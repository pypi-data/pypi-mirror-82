About
-----

**PreciSo** is a software written in `C++` and developped by `Michel Perez <https://michel.perez.net.free.fr>`_ and his co-workers.
It does classical nucleation and growth theories calculations for `precipitation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_nucleation_theory>`_ in metallurgical systems.
