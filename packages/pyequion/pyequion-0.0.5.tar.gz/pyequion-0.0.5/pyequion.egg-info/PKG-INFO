Description: # PyEquIon
        
        A pure python implementation for electrolytes chemical equilibrium.
        
        A simplified version is provided with a web based user interface: https://caiofcm.github.io/pyequion-onl/
        
        ## Features
        
        - Pure python package: hence it is easy to install in any platform
        - Calculation of equilibrium of inorganic salts in water solution with precipitation
        - Automatic determination of reactions
        - Provides information as: Ionic Strength, pH, Electric Conductivity and the concentrations of each species as well their activity coefficient
        - A modular approach for the activity coefficient calculation allows the usage of new thermodynamic models
        - Just in time compilation capabilities with `numba`
        - Automatic differentiation with `sympy`
        - Code generation for exporting the residual function for a giving system to other environments: suitable for kinetic simulations
        - Automatic determination of the mean activity coefficient (often used in comparison with experiments)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed with `pip install pyequion` or `pip install <folder>`
        
        ## Running Tests
        
        To run unit tests:
        
        ```
        pytest ./tests
        ```
        
        To create the test report:
        
        ```
        pytest --cov=pyequion ./tests/test_reactions_species_builder.py --cov-report=html
        ```
        
        
        ## Helpers
        
        - Code can be JIT compiled with `numba` calling the function: `pyequion.jit_compile_functions()`
        - When using JIT, running the code in `jupyter` becomes unstable, prefer regular python script.
