Description: # PyBookReader (WIP)
        
        Command Line Interface (CLI) application to read a PDF book for you, utilizing the Python Text-to-Speech library `pyttsx3` and `pdftotext` and a few others.
        You can have all your books stored in a directory and have `pybookreader` to scan, detect and store your books to an `SQLite` database. The database is stored locally in your computer so you don't have to worry about the books being stolen. Plus, the database only stores basic information such as book's name, path location and so on, not the book content.
