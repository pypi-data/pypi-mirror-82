# AnimalProfile

A python package for tagging animal experiments.

This package allows assigning tags and parameters to animals and experiments, to keep track of them and group similar conditions together.
Here is an example of a _profile_ file for an animal:

A similar file for each animal is created which consists of:
- __header__ parameters, which are labels for each animal.
such as its genetic background, its initial training method, etc.
In this example, 3 parameters are defined:
> "rewardType", "initialSpeed", and "option".
The "name" field is added automatically.
- __body__, seperated from the header by lack of a leading `#` character, consists of at least a _Sessions_ column and a _Tag_ column (added automatically).
The `_Sessions_ columns lists all the experiments, the _Tag_ column should include a descriptive and unique label for the experimental condition (e.g., _Early-Lesion-DLS_).
User can add more columns to the body (3 more columns in this example).

This package:
- detects new experiments, adds them to the _profile_ file.
- provides an interface for reading the profiles and grouping similar experiments for furthur analysis.
