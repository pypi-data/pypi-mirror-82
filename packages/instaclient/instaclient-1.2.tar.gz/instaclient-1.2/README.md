# instaclient

**instaclient** is a Python library for accessing Instagram's features.
With this library you can create Instagram Bots with ease and simplicity. The InstaClient takes advantage of the selenium library to excecute tasks which are not allowed in the Instagram Graph API (such as sending DMs).

The only thing you need to worry about is to spread your requests throughout the day to avoid reaching Instagram spam limits.
