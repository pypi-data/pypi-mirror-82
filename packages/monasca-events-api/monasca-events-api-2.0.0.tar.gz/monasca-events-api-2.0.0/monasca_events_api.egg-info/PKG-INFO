        Bug tracking
        ------------
        
        In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
        be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
        the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
        often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
        In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
