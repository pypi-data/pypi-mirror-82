greenback: reenter an asyncio or Trio event loop from synchronous code
======================================================================

Python 3.5 introduced ``async``/``await`` syntax for defining
functions that can run concurrently in a cooperative multitasking
framework such as ``asyncio`` or `Trio
<https://trio.readthedocs.io/>`__. Such frameworks have a number of advantages
over previous approaches to concurrency: they scale better than threads and are
`clearer about control flow <https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html>`__
than the implicit cooperative multitasking provided by ``gevent``. They're also being
actively developed to explore some `exciting new ideas about concurrent programming
<https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/>`__.

Porting an existing codebase to ``async``/``await`` syntax can be
challenging, though, since it's somewhat "viral": only an async
function can call another async function. That means you don't just have
to modify the functions that actually perform I/O; you also need to
(trivially) modify every function that directly or indirectly calls a
function that performs I/O. While the results are generally an improvement
("explicit is better than implicit"), getting there in one big step is not
always feasible.

``greenback`` is a small library that attempts to bridge this gap. It
allows you to **call back into async code from a syntactically
synchronous function**, as long as the synchronous function was
originally called from an async task (running in an asyncio or Trio
event loop) that set up a ``greenback`` trampoline as explained
below. That way, you can migrate your program to ``async``/``await``
syntax one layer at a time instead of all at once.

``greenback`` requires Python 3.6 or later and an implementation that
supports the ``greenlet`` library. Either CPython or PyPy should work.
There are no known OS dependencies.

Quickstart
----------

* Call ``await greenback.ensure_portal()`` at least once in each async
  task that will be using ``greenback``. (Additional calls in the same
  task do nothing.) You can think of this as creating a portal that
  will be used by future calls to :func:`greenback.await_` in the same
  task.

* Later, use ``greenback.await_(foo())`` as a replacement for
  ``await foo()`` in places where you can't write ``await``.
