===========================
Sale Stock Picking Blocking
===========================

This module extends the functionality of sales to allow you to block the
creation of deliveries from a sales order and give a reason.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to 'Sales > Configuration > Sales > Delivery Block Reason'.
#. Create the different reasons that can lead to block the deliveries of a
   sales order.
#. Add some users to the group 'Release Delivery Block in Sales Orders'.

Additionally, you can set a customer with a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'
policy to add that delivery block to his sales by default:

#. Go to 'Sales > Sales > Customers'.
#. In the 'Sales & Purchases' add a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'.
#. The 'Default Delivery Block Reason' will be added
   automatically when creating a new sales order for the customer.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a new sales order and provide a 'Delivery Block Reason'.
#. Confirm Sale (No delivery would be created).
#. Release Delivery Block when it is time to create the deliveries for
   the sales order.
