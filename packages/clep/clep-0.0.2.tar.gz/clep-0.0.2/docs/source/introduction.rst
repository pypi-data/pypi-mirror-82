CLEP: A Hybrid Data- and Knowledge- Driven Framework for Generating Patient Representations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLEP has three main subgroups: ``sample_scoring``, ``embedding``, ``classify``.

1. The ``sample_scoring`` module generates a score for every patient-feature pair.

2. The ``embedding`` module overlays the patients on the prior knowledge in-order generate a new KG, whose embedding
is generated using KGE models from PyKEEN(Ali, *et al.*,2020).

3. The ``classify`` module classifies the generated embedding model (or any data that is passed to it) using generic
classification models.

General info
-------------
CLEP is a framework that contains novel methods for generating patient representations from any patient level data and
its corresponding prior knowledge encoded in a knowledge graph. The framework is depicted in the graphic below

Installation
------------

In-order to install CLEP, an installation of R is **required** with a copy of Limma. Once they are installed, you
can install CLEP package from pypi.

.. code:: shell

   # Use pip to install the latest release
   $ python3 -m pip install clep

You may instead want to use the development version from Github, by running

.. code:: shell

   $ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/hybrid-kg/clep.git

For contributors, the repository can be cloned from `GitHub`_ and installed in editable mode using:

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/hybrid-kg/clep.git
   $ cd clep
   $ python3 -m pip install -e .

Dependency
--------------
- Python 3.6+
- Installation of R

Mandatory
~~~~~~~~~

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- rpy2 (for limma)
- Limma package from `bioconductor`_


For API information to use this library, see the :ref:`dev-guide`.
