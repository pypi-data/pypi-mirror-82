        **NOTE: STACKSEARCH IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. There will still be the occasional bug fixes and updates, but not as much.**
        
        
        StackSearch is a python module that provides a way to search [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
        
        The reason this is better than other modules is that this module provides a modern API, a beautiful command-line interface via argparse and blessings, all in pure Python.
        
        It is also available as a standalone command-line tool, so you may run it directly like so:
        
        ```bash
        stacksearch This is the query
        ```
        
        without the `python3 -m` prefix, if desired.
        
        It also has an API which you can use via
        
        ```python
        >>> from stackoverflow import Search
        >>> Search.Search("This is the query")
        ```
        
        Have fun!
        
        ## Benefits 👍
        
        The benefits of this module as opposed to the other StackOverflow-searching modules is that this module provides the following:
        
        - The ability to return a dictionary of _ALL_ the search results found, **not just the first result**
        - The ability to return results from a variety of different [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) sites
        - A **beautiful command-line interface _for humans_**
        - A decently documented API
        - An optional **asynchronous API**
        - Decently easy-to-read code (formatted with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black))
        - And **open source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThatXliner/stacksearch/tree/Stable)**
        
        ## Downsides 👎
        
        - Possibly _slower_ than the other modules
        - **The first PyPi project ever made by ThatXliner**
        - Not _fully_ (completely) optimized (well, after all, it's python)
        - ~~A big list of dependencies~~ (shortened in version 1.0.0 or so)
        
        ## Current Features 😁
        
        - **Everything listed in the 'Benefits' section of the README above**
        - Mostly, **if not fully**, [type-hinted](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/)
        - A **beautiful, simple, yet powerful command-line interface** (via [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) and [blessings](https://pypi.org/project/blessings/))
        - **Asynchronous** StackOverflow requests!
        - The ability to **crank out raw [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data** to **_use_**
        - And an **API**
        
        ## Future Features 🏃‍♂️
        
        - [x] ~~Asynchronous StackOverflow requests!~~ (Done in v1.1.0)
        - [x] [Documentation](https://stacksearch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (_Sort of_ added in v1.2.8)
        - [ ] Object-oriented APIs
        - [ ] Python backwards-compatibility (3.6 to 3.9)
        - [ ] Being able to scrape _all_ StackOverflow sites/pages
        - [x] ~~A better README~~ (Done in v1.0.0.1)
        - [ ] Being able to output different formats of data (e.g. YAML, TOML, XML, etc)
        - [ ] And more command-line options
        
        ## Usage Examples
        
        - For creating a text editor extension built on this package
        
        - For searching StackOverflow and/or **other StackExchange websites** without leaving the Terminal (for those [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) people)
        
        - For getting lots of answers from all StackExchange sites you know

        ## Code style guide 😳
        
        [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). We (I, right now.) use the black formatter to format our code. **It's pretty strict.**
        
        We also use NumPy style docstrings.
