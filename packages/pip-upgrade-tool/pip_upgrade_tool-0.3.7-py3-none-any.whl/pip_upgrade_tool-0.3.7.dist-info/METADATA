    pip install .

### version 0.3.7
Just run 'pip-upgrade' in your terminal while virtualenv is active.

    $ pip-upgrade

### Options
- `pip-upgrade --local`	By default locally installed editable packages (installed with `pip install . -e`) won't be upgraded. Use this option to upgrade everything.
- `pip-upgrade --novenv` By default the tool won't work if virtualenv is not active. Use this if you want use it globally and pass the assertion error.

- With some packages, there might be name check errors, because of dependency and package name case differences. Tools skips these and gives a warning for now. This will be improved.
