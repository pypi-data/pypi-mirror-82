        The purpose of pip-upgrade is to be a simple yet rebost and reliable tool for upgrading all of your packages while not breaking dependencies
        
        ## Installation
        
        	pip install pip-upgrade-tool
        	
        or	
        
            git clone https://github.com/realiti4/pip-upgrade.git
            cd pip-upgrade
            pip install .
        
        ### version 0.3.0
        Just run 'pip-upgrade' in your terminal while virtualenv is active.
        
            $ pip-upgrade
            
        #### TODO - known issues
        - Add an arg to not upgrade local packapes installed with 'pip install .'
        
        - This should be fixed with 0.3.0 - Let's say x package holding y. They got an update at the same time and now x package requires y at a higher minimum version than it was holding it for. y packege won't be upgraded unless 'pip-upgrade' is run twice.
