        MyAutoML is a project that aims to help data scientists become more efficient, by providing:
        
        - Cookiecutter templates
        - Example scripts (based on the Cookiecutter templates)
        - A Python package with functions to perform common tasks
        - A programming framework to automate as much as possible of the repetitive
          work a data scientist is likely to encounter.
        
        ### Getting started
        
        Install MyAutoML using `pip`:
        ```shell script
        pip install myautoml
        ```
        
        Import the Python package:
        ```python
        import myautoml as maml
        print(maml.__version__)
        ```
        
        Further documentation is under development.
        For now, have a look at the example `scripts`.
        
        
        ### Cookiecutters
        
        To use the Cookiecutter templates:
        ```shell script
        cookiecutter https://github.com/myautoml/myautoml.git --directory="cookiecutter/binary_classifier"
        ```
