# Parfis configuration file
# Parsing goes as following:
# 1. Space and tab is removed from file.
# 2. Comment lines start with '#', and end with newline. Comments are removed
#    from file.
# 3. Lines are recognized as 'key=value' strings, and end with newline.
# 4. Array values are given in the form 'key=[val1,val2,val3]' and end
#    with a new line.
# 5. Tuple values are given in the form 'key=(val1, val2, val3)' and end 
#    with a new line.

# For now only Cylindrical geometry is supported

# Size of the simulation space in meters (z is the longitudal axis)
space.size = (0.02, 0.02, 0.4)

# Size of a unit cell (all other cell sizes are multiples)
space.ucell = (2e-3, 2e-3, 2e-3)

# Particle names
particle.name = [e]

# Initial particles per unit cell
particle.ppc = [100]
