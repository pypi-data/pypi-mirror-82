Description: dash-datepicker
        ===============
        
        This is a dash datetime range picker based on
        `react-datetime <https://github.com/YouCanBookMe/react-datetime>`__. In
        contrast to the dash datepicker from dash-core-components, it is also
        possible to specify hours and minutes on a certain day.
