lftools v0.3.0 Release Notes
============================

Thanks to Anil, Trevor, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.2.0
----------------------------

5529081 Trevor Bramwell Add Jenkins to LF Tools
Adds some useful Jenkins commands to query Jenkins via lftools.

58a1793 Anil Belur      Report memory usage with sys-info
Adds sar reporting to the lf-infra-publisher so that we have some system
resource data at the end of each build.

c84a544 Thanh Ha        Add deploy nexus command
Adds a command to deploy RELEASE artifacts to Nexus using cURL. We currently do
not recommend using this for SNAPSHOTs as it's missing some code to generate
the maven-metadata.xml file that is needed by Maven projects to correctly
download the latest snapshot.

3c498dc Thanh Ha        Add deploy nexus-stage command
Adds a command to deploy RELEASE artifacts to a nexus staging repo.
