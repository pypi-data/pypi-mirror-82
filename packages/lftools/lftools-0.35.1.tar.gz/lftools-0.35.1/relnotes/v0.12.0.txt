lftools v0.12.0 Release Notes
=============================

Thanks to Anil, Jessica, Robert and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.11.0
----------------------------

8be6ebc Thanh Ha        Add lftools command to remove specific server
Adds a new remove server command that accepts an optional minutes parameter.
This allows us to ignore deleting a server if it is not at least a certain age
to prevent cleanup scripts deleting a server before it has a chance to connect
to Jenkins.

dd02080 Robert Varga    upload_to_nexus to return a non-zero exit status
Fixed a bug where upload_to_nexus did not properly return a failure state. This
would cause Jenkins to incorrectly log the upload as passed.

d28fe86 Thanh Ha        Add a groovy command to lftools
Adds a new groovy command which can be used to execute admin scripts against a
Jenkins instance. We plan to use this feature to enable management of global
Jenkins configuration.

fc50450 Jessica Wagantall       Fix wget command for Nexus sign script
Improves the sign script command to clone 15 levels of directories in Nexus
when signing artifacts. This is necessary as some projects have more than the
default number of nested subdirectories.

e42e0f5 Anil Belur      Print CPU, Memory, Disk and Network stats
This prints additional information about the system at the end of a job run.
