features:
  - |
    The shell/deploy file's copy_archives() function has been reimplemented in
    pure Python for better portability to Windows systems.
deprecations:
  - |
    The shell/deploy script's copy_archives() function is now deprecated and
    will be removed in a later version. We recommend migrating to the lftools
    pure Python implementation of this function.
