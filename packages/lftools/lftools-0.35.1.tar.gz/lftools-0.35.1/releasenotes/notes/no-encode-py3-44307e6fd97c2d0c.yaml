    Unicode compatibility in deploy_logs for Python 2 and 3 was improved in
    several ways. The former method to pull and write log files did not work
    properly in Python 3, and was not very robust for Python 2. Both reading
    and writing logs is now handled in a unicode-safe, 2/3 compatible way.
