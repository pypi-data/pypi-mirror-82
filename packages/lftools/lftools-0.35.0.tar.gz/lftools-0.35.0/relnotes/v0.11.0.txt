lftools v0.11.0 Release Notes
=============================

Thanks to Anil and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.10.0
----------------------------

bfa488e Thanh Ha        Use parallel to sign when available
lftools signing should now be significantly faster as we are now using parallel
to run gpg sign commands.

e396384 Thanh Ha        Add a snapshot mode to the deploy-nexus command
This change allows us to use cURL to upload snapshots to Nexus. Previously only
release artifacts were possible as we did not allow maven-metadata.xml files to
be pushed to Nexus. This exception is added for SNAPSHOT builds as this is
necessary in the case of SNAPSHOTs so that Maven builds can find the SNAPSHOT
artifacts.

68f40d3 Thanh Ha        Update openstack cmd to support ci_managed filter
Updated to support lf-infra in OpenStack scenarios. We use image metadata
fields to determine if an image is managed by lfci. This can be turned on or
off via "ci-managed" parameter on the CLI. Defaults to true.

f2bd527 Thanh Ha        Automatically hide protected images
This change automatically hides protected images. lftools uses this as a marker
to ignore the image and not manage it.
