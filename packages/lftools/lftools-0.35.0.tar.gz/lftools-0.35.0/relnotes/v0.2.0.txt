lftools v0.2.0 Release Notes
============================

Thanks to Andy, Anil, Jeremy, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Notable changes since v0.1.0
----------------------------

2e0c35e which removes version bumping from the end of the version "patch"
command. This was necessary as in OpenDaylight we're now using a Jenkins job to
perform the version bumping steps to make our release process quicker. The
patch command is still useful for tagging a release using a local GPG key.

eb919f2 which adds the Nexus artifact base target configuration which fixes
artifact deployments for Nexus projects.

fb32a2c which adds support to the openstack command to list and cleanup servers
based on age.
