    Remove pinned distlib requirement. Distlib is a common requirement for
    other libraries, and having it pinned is causing failures in builds. It is
    not explicitly used in lftools, so it does not need to be pinned. Fixes
    `ERROR: virtualenv 20.0.26 has requirement distlib<1,>=0.3.1, but you'll
    have distlib 0.3.0 which is incompatible.`
