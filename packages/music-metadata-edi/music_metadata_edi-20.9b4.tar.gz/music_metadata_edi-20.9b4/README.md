Music Metadata - EDI is a base for several EDI-based formats by CISAC, most 
notably Common Works Registration (CWR) and Common Royalty Distribution (CRD).

This library features common functionality for these formats, while specific formats are covered in other repositories.

You may test this library online, no coding skills required: https://music-metadata.herokuapp.com/

The demo also features up-to-date information.
