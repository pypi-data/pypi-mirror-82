# sc8pr

An educational programming package for [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org). Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org), sc8prâ€™s aim is to make it easy for new and experienced Python programmers to create animations, games, and other graphics-based programs.

sc8pr 2 features include:
* a simple, event-driven approach to creating interactive animations
* sprite management
* physics-based collisions
* video effects / transitions
* a selection of GUI controls
* curve plotting
* robotics simulator

For more information, please see the [documentation](http://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr/).

# Installation

Latest relase (2.1.2):
```
pip3 install sc8pr
```

Bug fixes:
```
pip3 install https://github.com/dmaccarthy/sc8pr/archive/BugFix-2.1.zip
```

Development version (2.2.dev):
```
pip3 install https://github.com/dmaccarthy/sc8pr/archive/master.zip
```

If setuptools is unable to locate a pygame wheel for your platform and Python version, you will need to install [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) separately.

See the documentation for more [detailed instructions](https://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr/?inst).

# Try It First

sc8pr is pure Python 3 code, so you can try it without running the setup. Just unzip the sc8pr package into your PYTHONPATH. You will still need pygame installed.
