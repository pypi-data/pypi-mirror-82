    The original design of k8s cluster health status is allowing
    the health status being updated by Magnum control plane. However,
    it doesn't work when the cluster is private. Now Magnum supports
    updating the k8s cluster health status via the Magnum cluster
    update API so that a controller (e.g. magnum-auto-healer) running
    inside the k8s cluster can call the Magnum update API to update
    the cluster health status.
