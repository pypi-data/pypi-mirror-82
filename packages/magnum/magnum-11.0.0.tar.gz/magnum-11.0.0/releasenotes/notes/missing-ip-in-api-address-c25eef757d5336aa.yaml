    There was a corner case that when floating_ip_enabled=False,
    master_lb_enabled=True,master_lb_floating_ip_enabled=False in
    cluster template, but setting floating_ip_enabled=True when
    creating the cluster, which causes missing IP address in the
    api_address of cluster. Now the isssue has been fixed.
