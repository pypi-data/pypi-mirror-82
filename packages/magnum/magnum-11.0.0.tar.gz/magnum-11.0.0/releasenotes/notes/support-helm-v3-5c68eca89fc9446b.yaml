features:
  - |
    Support Helm v3 client to install helm charts. To use this feature, users
    will need to use helm_client_tag>=v3.0.0 (default helm_client_tag=v3.2.1).
    All the existing chart used to depend on Helm v2, e.g. nginx ingress
    controller, metrics server, prometheus operator and prometheus adapter are
    now also installable using v3 client. Also introduce helm_client_sha256 and
    helm_client_url that users can specify to install non-default helm client
    version (https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).
upgrade:
  - |
    Default tiller_tag is set to v2.16.7. The charts remain compatible but
    helm_client_tag will also need to be set to the same value as tiller_tag,
    i.e. v2.16.7. In this case, the user will also need to provide
    helm_client_sha256 for the helm client binary intended for use.
deprecations:
  - |
    Support for Helm v2 client will be removed in X release.
