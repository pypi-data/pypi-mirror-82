    A new config option `post_install_manifest_url` is added to support installing
    cloud provider/vendor specific manifest after booted the k8s cluster.
    It's an URL pointing to the manifest file. For example, cloud admin
    can set their specific storageclass into this file, then it will be
    automatically setup after created the cluster.
