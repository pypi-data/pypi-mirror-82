    A new boolean flag is introduced in the CLuster and Nodegroup create API
    calls. Using this flag, users can override label values when clusters or
    nodegroups are created without having to specify all the inherited values.
    To do that, users have to specify the labels with their new values and use
    the flag --merge-labels. At the same time, three new fields are added in
    the cluster and nodegroup show outputs, showing the differences between the
    actual and the iherited labels.
