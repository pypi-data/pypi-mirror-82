    The devicemapper and overlay storage driver is deprecated in favor
    of overlay2 in docker, and will be removed in a future release from
    docker. Users of the devicemapper and overlay storage driver are
    recommended to migrate to a different storage driver, such as overlay2.
    overlay2 will be set as the default storage driver from Victoria cycle.
