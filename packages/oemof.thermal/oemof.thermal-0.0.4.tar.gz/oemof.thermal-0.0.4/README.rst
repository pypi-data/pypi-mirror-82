oemof.thermal
#############

This package provides tools to model thermal energy components as an extension of
oemof.solph, e.g. compression heat pumps, concentrating solar plants, thermal
storages and solar thermal collectors.

About
=====

The aim of oemof.thermal is to create a toolbox for building models of
thermal energy systems. Modeling thermal energy systems requires specific preprocessing
and postprocessing steps whose detail exceeds the generic formulation of components in
oemof.solph. Currently, most of the functions collected here are intended to be used
together with oemof.solph. However, in some instances they may be useful independently
of oemof.solph.

oemof.thermal is under active development. Contributions are welcome.

Quickstart
==========

Install oemof.thermal by running

.. code:: bash

    pip install oemof.thermal

in your virtualenv. In your code, you can import modules like e.g.:

.. code:: python

    from oemof.thermal import concentrating_solar_power

Also, have a look at the
`examples <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-thermal/tree/dev/examples>`_.
