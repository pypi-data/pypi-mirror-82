Description: # sopel-rainbow
        
        A Sopel plugin to make things RAINBOW COLORED.
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        By default, `sopel-rainbow` outputs colors in the "standard" rainbow `order`,
        ROYGBIV, subject to receiving clients' use of the customary meanings for IRC
        color codes 0-15. If set explicitly in your Sopel config file, this default
        value would look like:
        
        ```ini
        [rainbow]
        order =
            4
            7
            8
            3
            12
            2
            6
        ```
        
        If you want to get creative (or cater to a community with shared color norms
        that differ from the "de facto" values established by mIRC and friends)
        override the `order` with your own list of _numeric_ codes:
        
        ```ini
        [rainbow]
        order = # Americans and French can fight over this one
            4
            0
            2
        ```
        
        Starting the rainbow at the beginning of the `order` every time is also
        default behavior. If you want the rainbow to start at a random place every
        time instead, set the Boolean option `random_start` to `yes` or `on`:
        
        ```ini
        [rainbow]
        random_start = on
        ```
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Only Sopel itself, version 7.0 or higher.
        
        If installed on a bot using Sopel 7.1+, `sopel-rainbow` will strip control
        codes from the input text before applying the rainbow colors. (Sopel 7.0.x
        does not offer this feature, so feeding formatted text into the `.rainbow`
        command might yield unexpected results.)
        
        This version of `sopel-rainbow` will not work with Sopel 9.0+. A future
        release will correct this, sometime before Sopel 9 becomes stable.
        
        
        ## Changelog
        
        The brief, illustrious history of `sopel-rainbow`, a silly little plugin
        spawned from [a tongue-in-cheek
        upstream issue](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/issues/1962).
