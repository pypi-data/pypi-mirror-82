Description: # bsp_tool
         A library for .bsp file analysis & modification
        
        bsp_tool has no UI, it only provides a python interface to the contents of the requested .bsp  
        This interface is provideded via the `bsp_tool.bsp` class  
        At present the tool read .bsps from most Source Engine games, as well as Titanfall 2 & Apex Legends  
        
        The `mods/` folder contains classes for interpretting the lumps within .bsp files  
        bsp_tool needs to know each lump is constructed & this varies from game to game  
        `mods/common.py` provides some base classes  
        `vindictus.py` extends `team_fortress2.py`  
        
        At present, not every lump's exact format is understood  
        When a lump of unknown format is loaded, it becomes `RAW_LUMPNAME` and the raw data is preserved  
        
        The user can specify what game bsp_tool is to expect  
        If no game is specified, bsp_tool will guess based on the bsp version  
        Be aware that some games share a version, but have different lump formats  
        To know which format bsp_tool will default to, see `mods/__init__.py`
